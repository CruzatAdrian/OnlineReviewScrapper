We were the only customers in the store and the waiter was very nice. We ordered the egg custard tart, fried veggie  spring roll, beef chow fun, and thousand year old egg porridge with pork. Personally, I would not order the egg custard tart again because it was a bit too sweet for my taste. Otherwise, it&#39;s good. The spring rolls were fresh, light, and crispy. The beef chow fun was fresh from the wok and the noodles were al dente, in addition the meat was surprisingly buttery and not tough. The porridge has a peculiar taste, and not everyone would enjoy it. But personally it was yummy and helped cleansed my stomach.  In conclusion, Compared to all the dim sum I&#39;ve eaten so far, this place was on par."

BAR DRINKS:  I always get their traditional Warm Ozeki Sake, which always does the trick to getting any Asian meal started.  You can taste the fresh rice grains in good sake like Golden Port&#39;s.  The Infused Cold Sake w/ Asian Pear is a ripe cold sake to drink when it is on special. SUSHI:  You do not get many rolls for your buck. I ordered the Eel Roll, which look like little miniature pieces of eel on my plate.  The sushi pieces are so small I could barley fit the roll on my chopstick.  It was hard to judge the cutting skills, because there was not a whole lot of roll to cut. DIM SUMS:  Contrary to what people say, there Dim Sums are my least favorite food items&#39; here.  The Shu-mai (port dumpling) were a little doughy, which took away from the flavor of the pork inside.  The Spring Rolls lacked vegetables inside to make it more of a spring roll instead of looking like a fish-stick.  The Gyoza tasted great for the fact that every dumpling was seared nicely on top.  The beef inside was filled nicely to the ratio of dough. CHINESE ENTREE&#39;S:  The Szechwan Chicken was sizzling with the garlic, chili peppers, and ginger. The use of the Sichuan Pepper on top of the chicken was perfectly executed.  Sichuan in Chinese means a tingly numbing sensation in the mouth, and thats exactly what this meal did to me.  Portions for this meal are HUGE, like the Great Wall of China. THAI ENTREE&#39;S: I like the create your own Thai Dish. I go for the Beef Thai Noodle with the Orange Roughy Thai Sauce.  The Beef was seared nicely, never chewy in texture.  I was hesitant about the noddles, but they tasted buttery with a hint of ginger.  The Orange Roughy sauce completes this dish because it was thick in texture absorbing all the ingredients on the plate.  Combined with coconut flavor and a dash of orange zest, being Roughy is the way to go.  The  Masamaum is another great yellow curry sauce with coconut, veggies and peanuts.  The Panang sauce will also take you to the dark side.  It includes red curry, creamy coconut and basil.  I hope we get by now the sauces make the meal here, outstanding.   Again you get so much food, you have another box to walk home with. Overall:  Ozeki Saki, Mini-Sushi Rolls, Average Tasting Dim Sums, Flavorful Chinese and Thai Entrees. Amazing Thai Sauces, The Circle Menu,  High Quantity of Food, and the Golden Gong.....I will be back."

Golden Port Dim Sum&#39;s menu spans not only every typical American Chinese restaurant, but also several other Asian countries. This is usually a bad sign. After being a bit dubious of the menu choices, and coming here mostly to socialize after a movie, I opted for the bowl of hot/sour soup and egg roll. Both options are typical of what you&#39;d expect at every other Chinese restaurant. My choice did the job of giving me something to eat, but was nothing memorable. Given that there are many dim sum items on the menu, this is, I gather, the best way to order at Golden Port. You can order a traditional entree--but I didn&#39;t see anything on the table that I was interested in eating. Soup and egg roll are good choices when you don&#39;t feel like eating but are being polite. Service was prompt and totally un-phased by our very large group. This is largely the reason that I round up to two stars. They seem to have a very active business--which I suspect is, in large part, due to the movie theatre down the street. Either that or the expectations for Chinese is very low in Rochester. Possibly both reasons. :) In all, I would never go out of my way to go to Golden Port again. I might join others who want to eat here--but I&#39;d order only soup, tea, etc."

However, with Baked and Carved unexpectedly closed the night we were there, we decided to head to Golden Port right next door. The restaurant was a little dim and full of (Eastman School?) students. The menu featured Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, Japanese (from the connecting House of Sushi) and build-your-own-stir fry-or-soup options.  We had 2 people attending to our table - a very cheery server who didn&#39;t speak English very well and a more reserved but still friendly manager who answered all our questions. I asked our server if I could add lo mein to the Beef Ginger soup (Slices of beef simmered in a beef broth with Chinese greens (yu choy) and sliced ginger). She checked with the manager who said it wasn&#39;t a problem (it cost $1 extra..totally worth it). My friend got the seafood pho. The server also convinced us to try the curry beef turnovers. The food came out blazing fast. Oddly, the soups came out 15m before the turnovers. The seafood pho was okay. It wasn&#39;t bad but my friend said he would rather go to SEA for his pho fix. My beef ginger soup was a lot better than I expected but the beef had an odd aftertaste (maybe it was boiled for too long). I fixed it by dipping every bite in Sriracha ( a fix I apply to many weird tasting things.. ). The lo mein noodles were abundant and delicious. The curry beef turnovers...well, they were so good, they deserve their own paragraph. They were palm sized circular pastries stuffed to the brim with well seasoned ground beef. With the right level of curry and a slight note of sweetness (and a tonne of onions), this was easily the star of the night. If all I had were the beef turnovers, I would give Golden Port 5 stars. It cost $3.95 for 2 pieces which is a little pricey but I would pay it again. Golden Port and I will be crossing paths more often but I think it will be mostly for the curry beef turnovers. Next time, I think I will try the &#39;build-your-own&#39; stir fried noodles."

They have you circle what you want on the menu to prevent any miscommunication. I really enjoyed the Thai dish I ordered last night, which was chicken and vegetables with a sweet peanut sauce. They used the perfect amount of sauce and I applaud them for that since many places tend to drown their dishes in it! I also had the chance to try the moo-shu pork which was decent. The portions are huge and I always leave here with enough leftovers for another meal. If I could, I would give Golden Port 3.5 stars.

The veggie buns: The best part of what I ordered, definitely could have used some sauce because they were a bit dense by themselves. The hot and sour soup: Really meh. It was globby and like jelly, it was really strange. They did have some nice veggies (mushrooms, carrots, fresh scallions) so that was welcome, but still, not worth it. The pickled napa cabbage: Odd. Just odd. The flavor on it took a bit of time to get used to, but after the first few bites, it was alright. The consistency was  bit strange. I don&#39;t know if I would order it again.

The dim sum selection is impressive (made-to-order), although most of it is too greasy and lacks the weightlessness of real Dim Sum which needs to be airy, light and mildly flavored. The dumplings are pan fried to a crisp but the skin has a decidedly chewy texture, revealing its undercooked (cooked for too little time at a too-high temperature) nature. They&#39;d fare better by narrowing down the menu and choosing one theme and doing it well."

The dimsum at Golden Port is horrible compared to the ones i&#39;ve had in Hong Kong. Extremely depressing when you are craving dimsum and you go into a restaurant with the words &#34;dimsum&#34; written on the windows and the food tastes the way it does. The service is horrible. I was told by the waitress that i could special order any dimsum that i wanted even if it was not on the menu--but she could not understand what i wanted, and she refused to find someone that speaks my language to come translate. The sushi was okay. More fish and less rice, but I cannot complain about that I suppose. Food took a while to come out. The most annoying part was when the waitress brought out my food and some of it slipped and touched the table and she used her hands to move it back on the plate and tried to serve it to me, then gave me an attitude when I told her to take it back and have them re make it because it was contaminated by her filthy hands and the table. They also don&#39;t know how to refill water, apparently, because both mine and my boyfriends water cups were empty the entire night, even though the people came by and dropped off dishes and took dishes from our table. So.......come here if you want shitty dimsum. If you want good dimsum, go to hong kong. can&#39;t afford it? well...that just sucks now doesnt it?"

Ordering from a list is NOT &#34;Dim Sum&#34;. While the orders are about the same size, having things cooked to order completely ruins the entire idea of Dim Sum. On to of all that, the food here is really fairly bland and uninspired. They also offer an even more uninspired choice of sushi-like dishes, (which are even slightly more disappointing for those who actually know what real Asian foods are supposed to be), and the service in this place is curt and erratic. Add to that the lack of parking, and all in all, you can do better at any of a number of Chinese/Shushi/Asian  places in town.  The only saving grace this place has is it&#39;s location, so if you are truly stuck in the inner loop and can&#39;t get anywhere else, this place is probably the best you&#39;re going to find.

Am I an Eastman music student snob? Hell, no. (Not that there&#39;s anything wrong with Eastman. Or it&#39;s students.) But between getting an espresso at Java&#39;s and stopping here to get some quick chinese dim sum I certainly felt like a music snob for at least an hour. Let me just say that I did think the food was good. And I can certainly see why it is a staple in downtown Rochester. It serves generally authentic chinese food, and it does succeed in that. However, having been to a plethora of chinese restaurants in Manhattan, it might have paled in comparison. I ordered the Scallion Pancakes, Shrimp spring roll, and the shrimp dumplings. The Scallion Pancakes were, by far, the highlight of my meal. They were crispy and greasy; juicy and packed with just the right amount of scallions so that it wasn&#39;t overpowered with the onion-ey taste, yet there was enough of it there to really benefit from it&#39;s flavor. The sauce was also great, and I do have to commend the restaurant for giving us a sauce that was more than just the usual soy sauce so overplayed in chinese cuisine. The sauce was sweet and tangy with just a hint of salt played in as well. It was wonderful. Now onto the dumplings. They were some of the weaker dumplings I&#39;ve had in my life, and that includes restaurants in Manhattan and in Rochester alone (the Korean House, for example, serves much better dumplings than does Dim Sum.) The dumplings were just VERY starchy. The dough around it was too chewy and it was almost as if it was too watery. The way they must have cooked it turned it into a mess of starchy goo. The shrimp inside was also rather flavorless and lacked any real substance. The spring roll was decent. I found the texture inside to be a little strange, but the outside wrap was good.  I give it three stars because it is a little expensive for the amount of food you get. Also, it lacked some of the authenticity compared to other Asian cuisine places I&#39;ve visited. I will give Dim Sum another chance, though, for fear that maybe I just ordered some of the wrong things or came on a bad night, because it&#39;s obviously popular for a reason. All in all, though, my experience left me a little dissapointed."

Portion is small and the food itself seems to come from frozen packages. For the same price, you can get much better dim sum at authentic places elsewhere. They also offers other dishes such as thai noodles and vietname noodles (pho), both are dissapointing. The pad thai is overly sweet and the pho is SMALL and tastless.  However I still enjoy this place because of the items that they are NOT known for, ironic. The fried squid is a must have, very delicious and generous in portion. Perfect appertizer. The sushi here from House of Sushi which is right next door is excellent, surprisingly good. The sushi is fresh and the choices are abundant, although standard choices.  One thing about this place is that the chinese dish items they offer in the menu are Americanized, but if you talk directly with the manager, they can make it Asian style, just for you."

(Golden Port Dim Sum and House of Sushi are listed as two separate restaurants, but I&#39;m assuming that&#39;s been done for unspecified legal reasons.   The two are located side-by-side, a wide and open indoor archway connects them, and it&#39;s possible to order from one or both menus - both menus are given to diners.) I think of this restaurant pair when I&#39;m downtown and part of a group that includes people whose tastes are diversely picky (read: each has an absolute horror of certain ingredients and /or cooking styles).  An example of a group that would bring this restaurant combo to mind would include a vegan, a committed meat eater, someone who cannot tolerate spiced food (e.g. avoids all Indian restaurants as a matter of course), someone who is loathe to venture far from familiar foods, and someone with an appreciation for ethnic foods and a near-hatred of mainstream American foods.  It&#39;s tempting to concede defeat and suggest everyone fend for themselves, but GP / HoS supplies a more sociable solution.  My experience is that everyone can find something acceptable here; no one will achieve rapture, but as long as each makes an informed choice from the menu(s), no one will leave hungry or grumpy. The Golden Port menu (my comments on its companion restaurant are filed under House of Sushi&#39;s listing - although it feels absurd to address them separately...) is usually the one that I ignore.  Those who avoid ethnic and spicy cuisine and who are content with a dinner of Americanized Chinese food will likely enjoy these options, and others are advised to look elsewhere.  I&#39;ve tried a few of the vegetarian entrees and have been so disappointed in the monotone taste and gooey sauces that I&#39;ve no interest in sampling the Thai and Vietnamese dishes.  (Justification for this behavior:   I&#39;ve tried the Thai food at Siam -a sister restaurant in Corn Hill- and was unimpressed.)  There&#39;s been some praise for Golden Port&#39;s dim sum and starter offerings, but that&#39;s not a draw for me (most of these selections are deep-fried and/or overly greasy/rich foods, which I don&#39;t care for), however, I have ordered and liked the Chinese Greens with Oyster Sauce.   The service is best described as uncoordinated but emphasizing speed.  It doesn&#39;t appear that servers are assigned tables - we&#39;re typically served by 3-5 people during a meal.  The result is that the food we&#39;ve ordered arrives at random times (this is especially evident when we&#39;ve ordered a number of starters), sometimes items are forgotten, and occasionally there&#39;s a little awkwardness as some will receive their entrees earlier than others, but overall things tend to come out quickly.    Golden Port&#39;s food isn&#39;t for me, but it has pleased a number of my dining companions -  and that&#39;s the point."

The Ox and Stone, however, achieves the desired power combo of atmosphere, great food, and portions for sharing.  In fact, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if 4+ could share a whole mole chicken ($30) and feel quite content. And the mole chicken is damn good. Tender &amp; moist, served on a bed of black beans and spanish rice. It was some of the best chicken I&#39;ve ever had. I just wish there was a bit more mole sauce. As for tapas, you certainly could order a bunch as your meal, or with it. We tried the pig ears, sizzling shrimp, and a mahi mahi taco.  The pig ears are interesting... I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong with the way they make them, but pig ears themselves aren&#39;t very tasty. I probably wouldn&#39;t order them again.  But the sizzling shrimp was fantastic! It comes sizzling in a small pot and there were probably around a dozen of them in there. Served with toasted slices of baguette, it&#39;s a great sharing dish and well worth $11.  No issues with the mahi mahi taco except it&#39;s so small.

Food. 3.75. The bone marrow appetizer was enjoyable but more bone than marrow really and as a serving I expected more marrow, The presentation of large slices of a possible femur is novel, but trying mop up the yummy melted fat with the toasted bread doesn&#39;t work well and marrow was just a bit dry and not as buttery as I like. Good flavor tho&#39; - truly. The Carnitas entree (somewhat accurately described by our server Steven as &#34;a kind of make your taco&#34;) was good enough (as I sampled my dining partner&#39;s choice) with lots of flavors, and the side order of garlic and herb fries was also tasty. The Enchilada entree (I chose brisket with verde sauce) was kind of o.k. as sadly the brisket was lost amongst the tortillas, the creams, and the sauce (which had no heat at all- zero) and thus the meat had no notable flavor presence. I would not order it again or recommend it. Beverages: 4.25. The white sangria was crisp and tasty and the Honeycrisp cocktail was also enjoyable, and got better if you nibbled on the cinnamon dusted apple slices garnish and then drank, FWIW IMO. Atmosphere: 3.00. Just o.k. Yes, some might describe the interior lighting as romantic because it is dim and there are candles. Others might describe it inconsistently lit and slightly dim. While I don&#39;t care if I can see across a dining room I do like to see my plate and the drink menu with absolute clarity, and the lighting here was a few lumens too low at our table. I imagine that it would be quite bright at lunch or during the daylight but not so much at night. A pet peeve of mine is that the arched vaults of ceiling carry sound from across the dining rooms so other conversations are louder than they should be. Example: I could clearly hear the bartenders conversations (in reality almost every conversation in the room) despite my sitting 30+ feet across the room by the windows.   Service. Ugh 2.50-2.75. Steven appeared uninterested generally and was definitely without interest in knowing the menu - say, like the ingredients. Yes there was one positive for checking (or leaving the table abruptly as if appearing to check) to determine that the mole sauce is not gluten free... but the negatives definitely were the dominant impression. Examples: When asked about ingredients because of food allergies: we were told that the house made tortillas &#34;may be&#34; gluten free, because Steven thinks so, &#34; I think, yes, uh ya&#34; - finally, yes he&#39;s sure, but he is also sure the tortilla chips aren&#39;t gluten free. SO they order was placed as: o.k. if these GF then I &#39;l have those, which reasonably implies that this should be confirmed. We never got word whether it was or was not. And, when the tortillas arrive it can&#39;t be determined by taste or appearance (see atmosphere above as to the lighting) whether the tortillas are GF so those have to be avoided because we can&#39;t confirm with Steven because he doesn&#39;t come back to the table for 20 minutes. Also, he describes the deserts because, rather than get the menu, well &#34;I&#39;ll just tell you &#39;cause we only have three desserts&#34; - which he then only vaguely is able to list, with the Chocolate dessert described as only: &#34;like&#34; a flourless chocolate cake, but he doesn&#39;t mention the nuts and apple and pineapple chutney and whipped cream on the side, nor the cocoa and roasted pepper blend of flavors. I guess that&#39;s why managers and chefs make menus, so patrons can know what is available. I also kind of expect that when I or my dining partner finish a drink (cocktail or wine) that maybe the waiter should ask if we&#39;d like another. Nope didn&#39;t happen.  FWIW, the younger guy pouring water and helping clear the plates was efficient. FYI if your wanting make reservations for two you have to call, for four or more you can use the &#34;Table37&#34; app which is ok but not as useful as Opentable."

You walk in and the restaurant is beautifully decorated - ornate fixtures and rich colors, with a nice, big bar. We had made a reservation for 6 PM and were seated once we told the hostess we were ready.  Looking at the menu the drinks were pretty standard prices for the area, and you seemed to get a good portion. My mother got the red sangria and she loved it. We asked if they do pitchers of beer/sangria and were directed to the $36 punch bowl. We were too cheap for that, maybe next time!  At 6 PM, the restaurant was already VERY loud. I jokingly asked my architect friend if he could fill out a comment card with some suggestions on how to fix that. It was so loud at this point that we had to ask the waitress to come around to the other end of the table to re-read the specials since we couldn&#39;t hear her when she was 5 feet away. To start we ordered the chapulines, lamb meatballs, chips and guac, empanadas and the crispy pig ears. My favorite was hands down the the homemade tortilla chips and guac. Ohhhhh, my those were heaven. The pig ears were a little chewy - like Andrew G remarked - not super appetizing when they&#39;re chewy. The lamb meatballs were very good too, but at $9 a pop for 3 golfball sized balls, I&#39;ll skip them next time.  I ordered the chicken Enchiladas verde for dinner ($18) and they were good! Other meals had and enjoyed were the carnitas, chicken mole, fish tacos, and the burger. Everyone seemed like they enjoyed their dinners.  We took a pass on dessert, as we had already rung up a bill of about $225.  Throughout the meal the service was definitely good, but could have been a little more attentive. My water was refilled often, but my empty beer glass sat empty on the edge of the table for a couple very long stretches of time. The food was very good, but definitely has that &#34;posh tax&#34; on it, mentioned by other yelpers. I&#39;d say that $18 for 2 enchiladas is quite expensive. I would have been more okay paying $14 for that dish, tops. BUT, you&#39;re in the East End, so when in Rome, spend the extra $4.  I will most definitely be back, I&#39;m hoping they have outdoor seating once it&#39;s nice? Maybe that will help the noise situation. I&#39;m itching to try a bunch of those cocktails and eat 7 orders of the chips and guac."

I&#39;ve been craving some good Latin food and unfortunately this place didn&#39;t cut it for me.  On the bright side they were pretty good at seating us at our reservation time. We expected to wait a little bit because it looked pretty busy but we were seated pretty much right away.  However!!! We waited 40 minutes for our appetizers. I didn&#39;t expect guacamole to take 40 minutes, even if the pig ears did. Our server didn&#39;t even realize that we had been waiting for so long until we asked him where our food was. He was very apologetic and the manager came out to apologize and comped our 2 appetizers.   Chips and guac was mediocre. The pig ears were ok, but got a little too oily/greasy/artery cloggy toward the end of it. It would be a good appetizer to share among a large group, not really for 2 people.  I ordered the paella and was super disappointed with it. I don&#39;t know what I expected from Rochester but certainly didn&#39;t expect soggy and sticky rice with zero saffron flavor. The rice was cooked very inconsistently because some of the rice was super soggy and some were undercooked. It seems like they may have just added more raw rice to bulk up the dish after it was cooked. Bleh :( We also had their bread pudding, which was passable, but after such a poor experience we were just ready to leave."

If you have a bigger group, request the Tonga Room, which has lots of space for a mini-party. We fit ~15 around a table for a birthday dinner. Plus, a couple couches and it&#39;s set back from the main dining so it&#39;s semi-private. The ambiance is really cool and reminiscent of a Spanish-style abode. A few things I enjoyed:<br>- Mac &amp; cheese is served in a cast iron pan -- could be shared with a couple people for an app or as an entree (which I did). Super creamy with manchego cheese, which I love and subtle heat.<br>- Fish tacos are my fave on the menu -- everything is fresh and crispy and the flavors blend perfectly.<br>- I LOVE the homemade tortilla chips. Thank you to the man who hand presses those in the kitchen. Crispy, crunchy, salty -- get &#39;em with guac.<br>- Margaritas are a must.

They have a really cool option for cocktails where the bartender well create a drink for you if you tell them what alcohol you want.  We got guacamole and chips, which were very good. The chips are freshly made and the guacamole tasted really fresh too. The Spanish poutine was my favorite dish. It was a good size too. I had the enchiladas as well, which were ok.

So what did we learn - this place is so trendy and crowded that they continue to have some bugs to work out.  The downstairs is pretty loud and the upstairs is almost too quiet (they wanted to seat the 4 of us there when we arrived for our 6:30 reservation but we wanted to be in the action... but be warned it can be very loud).  Prices are ok but $5 extra for rice and beans as side seemed a bit steep.  The cocktail menu is great but it is more interesting to order those at the bar to watch the bartenders work their magic (we had stopped in this fall for a drink and it was quite entertaining). This place is so trendy I fear that it will burn out before it gets its act together."

The service was awesome, and our waiter was super friendly and gave us knowledgeable and thoughtful recommendations when it came to drinks.

The homemade tortilla chips are thick, crispy, and delicious and pair very nicely with the pico de gallo, but the portion of guacamole that comes with the chips (an appetizer) is VERY small. Overall, the rest of the food was good though I really found myself wishing they used the more traditional corn tortillas instead of flour; however, I understand that I&#39;m probably in the minority on this one. The space feels inviting with a large bar area at the front connected to an even larger dining space in the back; it&#39;s nice how separate these two spaces are so the dining room can continue to feel intimate even as bar-goers start to filter in later in the evening.  I&#39;d be a little careful of the drinks here. Some of their signature cocktails pair things that should never be put together, namely brown liquor and tequila. And some of the signature drinks depart pretty handily from the Mexican/Latin theme of the place. But that being said, the traditional Mexican cocktails, margaritas, and mojitos, are pretty decent.  Overall, Ox and Stone gives a high-end Mexican dining experience, something that was missing in Rochester. We&#39;ll be back."

I felt like I was on the set of the 90s movie, The Mask of Zorro.  I was wooed by the warm, earthy, gold and brown tones, curves of the Spanish-style archways, the elegant gold frames outlined against the stucco walls, and the wrought-iron wall as an embellishment.  Add the dim lighting, candles on the tables, Spanish music in the air, a few booths and it becomes a perfect spot for a romantic, intimate dinner.  This is just the downstairs.  I didn&#39;t get a chance to be swept off of my feet by the upstairs, yet. Looks isn&#39;t everything.  We walked in to find a good group at the bar and the bartender attending to his customers.  We stood for a few minutes looking around because we didn&#39;t see a host or waiters.  Eventually, we were hastily greeted and seated and he disappeared before I could ask about the lunch menu he left behind.  Apparently dinner started at 6pm, we had 10 mins left of lunch, but weren&#39;t asked which we preferred.           Our waiter dropped off a bottle of water at our table and didn&#39;t fill our glasses.  That was the first time I&#39;ve experienced that.  No biggie.  My arms work, but for the image portrayed and the pricing, I was expecting him to fill my glass during the greeting.  He brought the dinner menu and I was glad that I asked because the lunch options (tacos) are on the dinner menu as well.  He did mention that it was only day two of their full dinner menu.  As the night went on, it started to get better. Based on my tastebuds that night, the server recommended pisco sour.  He even offered to buy it if I didn&#39;t like it, but no need.  It was a great choice.  It tasted like a margarita, but lighter and delightfully refreshing.  I enjoyed the texture and temperature combination of the cool drink and a taste of the room temperature froth with each sip.  It was not overbearing with liquor or lime. I wasn&#39;t that impressed with the entree selections.  The dishes ranged from $12-$30 and I wasn&#39;t enticed to pay over $20 for a dish with rice and beans.  After skipping over half the menu of various tacos, left with only two or three entrees that sounded interesting.  I was more excited about the starters - pig ears and critters.   We were feeling adventurous and started with chapulines, fried grasshoppers.  The bites were surprisingly light.  The small critters (about 1/2&#34; in length) were suntanning on a bed of garnish and seasoned with salt, pepper and a hint of lime.  The airy, light crunch texture reminded me of excess pieces of fried chicken crumbs or panko shavings.   The savory sauce had a hint of what tasted like peanut butter, and it was a thinner hummus texture.  I didn&#39;t know what to expect since I&#39;ve never had a Spanish noodle dish, but the braised oxtail entree was tasty.  The imperfections of the wavy, slightly flattened spaghett-like noodles leads me to believe that they are made fresh.  It complimented the tender pulled oxtail meat and had a savory, hearty bbq flavor with a nice garnish of cilantro.  At the top of the mound was a poached egg.  I would have preferred two eggs so that I could drizzle the yolk over more of the dish.  The portion is less than what I&#39;m used to for a pasta dish because I usually have to take it home, but the amount was satisfying and I wasn&#39;t uncomfortably stuffed.   I had a taste of the tacos, one cod and the other shrimp.  The dish came with two, but they let my friend mix and match.  I favored the flaky cod over the shrimp.  They were both topped with a coleslaw and wrapped up with a traditional taco which is softly dense and grainy, and based on texture, probably corn tortilla.  I didn&#39;t try enough of it to know if the slaws were different. I like the atmosphere and would go back again to try other dishes, but probably more so to mellow out from a long work day and enjoy a drink."

I went to Ox and Stone on a weekday this week and although it was a relatively non-busy night, I&#39;ve not experienced service this bad in quite some time.  In fact, service was so incredibly awful that even the food misses seemed like nothing compared to what we were put through.   Firstly, when we walked in, there was no one waiting to greet us.  We had to stand around for several minutes before staff actually realized we were there to dine in where we were finally left at a table to review the menus.  After sitting down and reviewing the menu, it took a good 10 - 20 minutes before a waiter finally came by to our table for our DRINK orders and to tell us about the specials.   Turns out we were sat down and completely forgotten about.   So despite Ox and Stone being relatively vacant on this Tuesday evening, there was no waiter assigned to our table.  RIdiculous.  During the meal itself, our glasses were left empty for the most part with the server only appearing once in a blue moon.  What&#39;s most frustrating about this is that on more than one occasion I caught him at the bar laughing and chatting with his coworkers totally unaware of the disgruntled air building at our table.   At the end of the night, they comped us a free dessert, but a free shoddy dessert with no sauce wasn&#39;t enough to make up for the nightmarish disaster wrought on by the flawed staff. As for the food - I can take it or leave it.  The oxtail in the oxtail bolognese was braised, tender, and truly delicious.  The pasta however was undercooked, extremely thick, and not rolled out nearly thin enough.  It definitely was probably at least 2x as thick as I&#39;d expect pappardelle to be which led it to be extremely chewy.  This certainly wasn&#39;t helping the situation any. Speaking of disappointing, the fried pig ear appetizer was underdone.  They were somewhat crisp on the outside, but as you bit into it and chewed it, the collagen and chewiness inside was oppressive to everyone&#39;s taste buds.  Something fried like that should not be so soft, mushy, and chewy on the inside.  It&#39;s just not pleasant. I honestly don&#39;t know when or if I&#39;ll be back.  Service (not to mention the average food) was such a disappointment that I wouldn&#39;t even go back for drinks."

I normally would consider this a bigger deal, but the place is just recently open, and it may change. My friends ordered mostly beers, but the two drinks we ordered were either OK (the mojito) or a disappointment (the piña colada). The piña colada wasn&#39;t bad, but honestly it needed more piña and more coconut, it was really boozy and served on a large cup, so those were pluses. I would probably not order that again though. I want to go again and try their food, but it probably will be a while, since their service was so spotty."

It&#39;s definitely quirky; yes its mexican-ish but don&#39;t come here expecting authentic south of the border cuisine. My barbacoa tacos were small, but the meat was fall apart tender and perfectly seasoned, and I didn&#39;t have to pick gristle out of my teeth afterward. My better half ordered the enchiladas verdes and his plate was cleaned, although he lamented the fact that this was the 2nd time he had been here and they were out of the chapulines. Our awkward waiter had some silly excuse, that the crickets were on backorder from Louisiana? They have plenty of crickets right here in Rochester last time I checked, but anyway... The Sangria they have has an odd anise/licorice taste to it, and its overpriced, like most of the items on the menu. Even though this restaurant doesn&#39;t offer the best value, I think it is worth checking out. I&#39;ll be back for date nights, and other special occasions."

Drove over to Alexander and I remembered this building. I think it used to be some other awesome bar 10 something years ago and it&#39;s still right across the street from The Old Toad Pub. But I am very glad they kept the building! The interiors are amazing with dimmed lighting at the entrance lounge and front bar. Very modern and romantic south-western kind of feeling. I can&#39;t explain it, go see it for yourself at night! The kitchen was still open!!! Yay!!!! We sat at the front bar, ordered guac and chips and our hungry friend ordered a burger.  The chef brought out the food and introduced himself. Everything was delicious. Pricing is perfect. I hope they stick around for a long time as it is a known fact that several bars and restaurants have come and gone on East/Alexander more than we can count. Oh yeah, the bathrooms are gorgeous!! I had to take a couple of selfies in there.... yah I was drunk, but gosh, GORGEOUS bathroom!!  Right when I left, the bartender told me to wait and came back with a pretty rose to give me!

I&#39;d rate the place a 3.5 if I could do half stars. It&#39;s a pleasant choice for a night of cocktails and food, although there were some misses with a few parts of the dining experience the two times I&#39;ve been. The drinks have been very good on all my visits. The bartenders are fun and very accommodating: tell them what you like and they&#39;ll create something tasty. The bar is quite spacious and a nice place to mingle while waiting for a seat.  Yes, note the &#34;while waiting&#34; part of that sentence. We were told our table would be ready in a half hour. 1.5 hrs later, we were still waiting. The host laughed and shrugged when he saw us sitting at our table two hours later.  &#34;Oh did I quote you a half hour?&#34; he chortled as he flounced away. Good natured? Yes. Helpful? No. Make a reservation and be flexible on the weekends would be my advice. The menu is mostly tacos a la carte and then some moderately expensive entrees. We tried a combination of them. Pork belly taco was good. Pulled pork was eh. Kind of dry. Calamari was tasty but not spectacular. The rice and beans were bland. I did enjoy the brisket taco, but was a little disappointed by the Mahi Mahi taco, given that I&#39;ve enjoyed the fish tacos at Dorado mightily in the past. Overall some highs and lows but still decent. For the ambiance, location, great drinks and variety of offerings, I would return to Ox and Stone for drinks and food again. I think this restaurant is more enjoyable as an adjunctive to fun company, not as a destination specifically for the meal."

Ox and Stone boasts a nice cocktail menu.  They have all the classic Mexican cocktails as well as some delicious craft/mixology level drinks.  I went for the Local Celebrity, and the boyfriend got the 104 Spritz.  It&#39;s really hard to mess up a $9 fancy cocktail, at least in my experience.  Our drinks were delicious! For food, we were unsure about portions but our waiter helped us out with our questions.  Mexican restaurants are always a crap shoot, because sometimes tacos are gigantic and other times tiny.  We each ordered a taco and an enchilada plate.  I went with the pork belly taco and chicken mole enchilada.  The boyfriend tried the chicken tinga taco and traditional chicken enchilada.  The tacos were pretty good, and definitely on the smaller side.  I&#39;d say they border on a bit overpriced, but they were tasty nonetheless. We both really enjoyed the enchiladas.  I thought the traditional sauce tasted a bit bland and boring (bf enjoyed though), but the mole was well made and very flavorful.  A give this place bonus for not referring to mole as &#34;chocolaty-sauce&#34; like some Mexican restaurants do! Service was good but spotty at times, especially toward the end with getting our check.  However everyone was friendly, and we enjoyed our experience very much."

Our ears were ringing when we left. Probably better to visit this place for lunch, or on a slower week night for dinner. Or, bring ear plugs and be prepared to yell. Acoustical problems are ALWAYS the fault of management because they forgot to ask their architects to deal with it, or they were aware of what would happen and they didn&#39;t care. For other examples of such nonsense, visit Good Luck or the Revelry. If you complain about it, some venue operators will tell you that they weren&#39;t allowed to make acoustical modifications to historic buildings. Two architects have told me that this is a lame excuse and that there&#39;s ALWAYS a way to improve acoustics. One more suggestion for the &#34;management&#34; here: Shut off the music at peak periods. It contributes nothing but more noise. I shouldn&#39;t have to tell you this."

They allowed us to essentially commandeer their entire patio. The servers were more than helpful as they pushed tables together and pulled chairs from everywhere, and brought full water glasses for everyone. Of the many hospitable things they did though, the most hospitable thing was to allow us all to order drinks at our own pace from the bar, the waiter, whomever. It eliminated a lot of needless waiting and concerns about being on one check when some of us were entirely too drunk and a threat to ghost at any time. Instead of each staff member being concerned about individual tips, they all worked together to show us a good time, and we appreciated it. Thanks Ox &amp; Stone.  Also, thank you for the excellent guacamole, the eminently decent cocktails, the $4 beers, and the $25 punch bowls.

My girlfriend and I met up with another couple on a Thursday night at Ox and Stone. We got there a bit before our reservation so we stopped at the bar for a cocktail. The bartender was very engaging and fun to talk to. I went for the &#34;pick a spirit and we&#39;ll make you a drink&#34; drink. I chose bourbon. The red bearded bartender came back with a lemon and Maker&#39;s Mark mixture that was delicious. After our friends showed up we went to our table.  The decor of the building is great. Everything is upscale but not to the point where you would feel uncomfortable wearing jeans and just having a few drinks. The wait staff was super responsive and always great. Mateo our waiter made a lot of great suggestions and was eager to answer questions about the menu.  At the chef&#39;s suggestion we got the &#34;Chef Board&#34; charcuterie. What a treat this was. The cheeses went from mild to sharp. The meats were delicate and delicious. The greens, veggies and sauce were great compliments to the array of cheeses and meats. My friends and I casually dined on the appetizer and sipped our drinks and the night was going great. Mateo and the wait staff were always there filling our waters and taking away unused dishware as the night went on.  Once we looked over the menu and asked Mateo a few questions that he gladly answered we were almost ready to order. My friend wanted a seafood suggestion and to our surprise the chef, Matt, came out to our table and personally suggested the swordfish special for that night. After carefully explaining the meal to my friend she was convinced and we were all excited for our meals.  I ordered the Mole Negro. A quarter chicken with a spicy mole over rice and beans. It was delicious. The rice and bean mixture was such a great complement to the organic and tasty chicken. I ordered a brisket taco on the side and it was phenomenal. One taco for $5 seems like a stretch but honestly, it was worth it. The tortilla was tasty and the meat was tender.  The only other meal I tried was a small bite of the swordfish. I hate seafood. I hate it. But this swordfish was so tender, so light, and the tomato, greens, hummus mixture it was paired with was absolutely amazing.  Overall, this meal was great. I am amazed at the attention of the wait staff. Matt the chef even came back out to see if my friend had liked her seafood suggestion. Such an impressive establishment. So happy that this is a part of downtown Rochester."

Sure, the bartenders take their time making them, but I&#39;ll wait an extra few minutes for a good cocktail any day of the week. The main reason for 3 stars? The food. Yikes.  Since it was after 10, our crew was forced to use the late night menu. With few options, we scooped up some chicken empanadas and an order of guac n chips. With the empanadas, it looked like their wasn&#39;t really dough. I really thought I was just eating a piece of fried chicken. Real heavy and not good. On to the chips (fried slices of pita) and guacamole. Well, the guac wasn&#39;t homemade, which is kinda lame. How do I know this? My bud had a large piece of plastic in his mouth after taking a bite of some. The kind of plastic that comes from a tub of guac. So, please Ox, don&#39;t put store bought shit into a mason jar and charge $6-10 for it. And if you do, at least hide the evidence.  End result... come for the drinks and cool atmosphere.

The ambiance is fantastic... I felt like I stepped back in time to a rustic castle. Just what Rochester needs. The menu was out-of-the-ordinary as well. The service was a bit slow, but we saw him running all over the place, and we suspect that our server was covering more than just his section, and they are new, so the slow service is forgiven. We ordered chips and guacamole for an appetizer. It was fantastic. Obviously homemade. The chips were thick, hot, and lovely. The guac was fresh and flavorful. Spot on. And definitely different from the traditional style tortilla chips at most Latin restaurants. I ordered the Mahi Mahi Tacos (since the server said the Mahi Mahi was wild caught = yay!), and they were delicious. $12 for two tacos with no sides. I see why some people are put off by that, but they were very high quality so I didn&#39;t really mind...  Hubby had the Dorado (Mahi Mahi, rub, arroz con crema) and it was cooked perfectly. We wished there was more of the delicious garnish on the plate, but it was still very good and we&#39;d order it again. Hubby had a plain old rum &amp; coke, and it was fine. I ordered one of their fancy cocktails - a sangria - and it was nice. Didn&#39;t taste like there was any alcohol in it, but I&#39;m sure there was.  And overall, we had a nice dinner in an elegant setting, with cocktails, appetizer, and two meals... And still got out of there for $50. So... The prices are fine.  They have their own parking lot, which was great. There are no parking lights, so it was super dark when we got out. I definitely recommend it for dinner. It was quite loud in there, so maybe it&#39;d be better with a smaller group; I&#39;m sure in a large group you won&#39;t be able to hear each other. <br>We will wait a little bit for them to get the kinks out of their service, but we will definitely be back. Stoked that Rochester has an offering like this!"

They still had sit down service, so we stopped in and were very impressed. This is easily the best new Rochester restaurant since the Revelry opened. The inside of the building is absolutely stunning. It is beautifully arranged, there is plenty of space between each table and the decor is very fitting of the Latin American theme of the place. Each table has a small centerpiece that is classy but not overwhelmingly large such that it gets in the way. The tables and chairs were comfortable and fit in perfectly with the milieu of the place. The service throughout the entire meal was unquestionably excellent (though it was very quiet in the place given it wasn&#39;t &#34;fully&#34; open at the time). The server we had was very attentive and wasn&#39;t overly overbearing. The staff was also quite attractive, but was very appropriately dressed.  The bar staff was also pretty prompt in getting our drinks (which were delicious). We started off with a mojito, perfectly minty, and the Hemmingway, which was a perfect mild summer fruit-based cocktail. At $9 for a drink, I think the price was very comparable to other fine dining establishments in the city. The wine list was small, but fitting with the menu. All the wines were from either the Iberian Peninsula or Argentina/Chile. The beer selection was equally fitting, though also included some New York beers (Ommegang, Brooklyn Brewery, Genny Cream). We started with the guacamole which came with some fried tortilla shells. This dish was sublime. The shells were amazing, coated with a delicious spice and perfectly cooked. The guacamole was a perfect fit, clearly fresh without an overwhelming amount of spice. It was the perfect start to a meal. When then had the mahi mahi tacos and the carne asada tacos for dinner. Both meats were perfectly prepared with a stunning amount of flavor and filler was ideal accompaniment. The shells were fresh prepared and right up there with some of the best Tex-Mex places I&#39;ve been to in the Southwest. Overall, an exceptional eatery that is a welcome addition to the Rochester restaurant scene. This place is a must visit. I can&#39;t wait to go back with a full menu."

Summary 1- solidly good food, excellent service, excellent ambiance = I knew I&#39;d be back. The second time back was for late night dinner. My friend and I shared the Spanish poutine with chorizo and the barbacoa. I could have eaten the poutine for days, and my friend (foodie from Houston and DC) raved about the barbacoa.

If you like mexican/Latin-inspired food, definitely worth a try.   There are a few (not many) gluten-free options.  Unfortunately they fry everything in one frier so the house-made chips aren&#39;t gluten-free, and most of the more interesting things on the menu are therefore also off limits (pig ears, grasshoppers).  We tried two of the gluten-free tacos and enchiladas, and all of it was excellent."

The barbacoa tacos were very tasty with a nice balance of flavor and fat. The fresh made tortillas tasted great but didn&#39;t hold together well.  The service was friendly and of average speed. The cheap dish towels as napkins are a turn-off - they suggest a restaurant that ran out of nice napkins and had to press their dish rags into service.  Overall, three stars for being average (some highs and some lows) but overpriced. Based on what I experienced, I wouldn&#39;t pay $16 for enchiladas."

The guac was fine, but not stellar, but the chips were awesome. I&#39;d get the lowest priced guac just for the chips. The oxtail croquettes were totally not worth $8 for 2. They each had just one small piece of oxtail and the rest was potatoes and they weren&#39;t very flavorful. Onto dinner, I ordered the mahi mahi tacos and while they were decent, they definitely weren&#39;t worth $6 a piece. The homemade tortillas were good. My husband ordered the fajitas and was not impressed with the flavor or quantity of food for $21. I tasted the sauce and it was good, but you kind of expect a little more than 2 small pieces of meat and 1 small pepper.  Our companions really enjoyed the Pisco Sour cocktail and braised oxtail.

My friend was brave enough to try their crickets while I ordered the empanadas. The crickets were surprisingly good if you can get past seeing their small bodies and legs. The empanadas were pretty good with the sauce. We both ordered the tacos (carne asada and seafood). My carne asada tacos left something to be desired. Coming from San Diego, I have a high bar for tacos and unfortunately, these tacos didn&#39;t make it, especially for the price (2 for $12)!

Starting at the beginning, the cocktails ($9):<br>- 104 Spritz was light and fresh, not too sweet.  I may have ordered it again, but I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t, because it was completely overshadowed by the ...<br>-  Local Celebrity, which suited its name exactly.  This drink got passed all the way around the table, and everybody -- everybody! -- was pleased.<br>- Movie Date is good in theory, but didn&#39;t deliver ... it tasted like a $9 rum and coke.<br>- Hemingway was my sister-in-law&#39;s fave, but tasted a little too &#34;yup, that&#39;s alcohol, all right&#34; for me Side note:  The next table over got the punch bowl, and I was very jealous ... definitely worth considering. Appetizers:<br>- The chips with salsa and also with guac: the guac was SPECTACULAR, and I could not stop eating it.  Seriously, so good.  The only problem was that you really got veryvery little -- maybe enough for 8 chips.  <br>- Pig&#39;s ears:  they tasted like fried strips of something.  Maybe a little tougher than your average fried strips of something.<br>- Crickets:  I was expecting a plate of battered, indistinguishable insects.  Instead, I had a plate of VERY LIFELIKE AND INSECT LOOKING INSECTS.  These puppies are not for the feint of heart.  But if you can get over the fact that you are literally eating an insect, it&#39;s not so bad.  Once you place one of these little suckers on your tongue, I promise it will not feel like you are eating an insect.  It will feel and taste like you are eating a crispy, completely hollow french fry.  But it&#39;s worth the price just for the general squeamishness as your friends try to psych themselves up for the experience. Dinner:<br>- Baja fish and pork belly tacos:  no surprises here; we give them a B-.  (Pro tip:  if you&#39;re ordering tacos, order 3 - 4 to replace a standard sized entree.)  I generously let my hubby finish both of these guys so I could focus all of my hunger on the ..<br>- Braised Oxtail &#34;Om nom nom nom&#34; Pasta:  tender and savory beef, expertly crafted pasta, every single bite was pure heaven.  Please just order this.<br>- I do not remember what my sister-in-law ordered, but I do remember that she did not eat it -- it seems that while three quarters of the dishes have cilantro listed, some of the quarter that don&#39;t, also include cilantro.  So be sure to ask if you have that pesky cilantro-tastes-like-soap gene."

If you are looking for delicious food, then I suggest you go elsewhere. <br>My bf and I tried the crickets, chicken empanadas, mac &amp; cheese,  2 tacos and the chimmichurri steak dish. <br>The best item: the crickets! It sounds gross but with the smokey sauce, they were crispy and delicious.<br>The chicken empanadas tasted like the dough was frozen. It was tough and lacked the crispness an empanada deserves. Also, the filling desperately needed seasoning. The mac &amp; cheese...was mac &amp; cheese. Nothing stood out about it. I needed to add salt and pepper. <br>When the tacos came out, I immediately noticed the topping vs meat ratio. The tacos were mostly filling, not meat. At $5 a pop, I expected at least 1/2 &amp; 1/2. I ordered the mahi mahi and steak tacos. The fish was overcooked and lacked the juiciness you expect when biting into any fish. The steak taco was  somewhat enjoyable, but again, I would&#39;ve appreciated more meat. <br>The final item was the chimmichurri steak. It was tender, juicy and delicious.  However, it was served over an overbearing amount of kale, which was salty and confusing. We ate the steak but didn&#39;t touch the kale. It was too much and looked unappetizing sitting in a soup of steak juice.<br>All in all, we left feeling hungry after spending $100...THAT SHOULD NOT HAPPEN.<br>The best part of the experience was the service...but what we really wanted was flavorful food.<br>Disappointing."

While vegetarian options are limited, they were sufficient. Others have commented on the slow service. While it was a bit slow on our first visit, you can&#39;t walk into a packed restaurant and expect to be treated like the only person in the house. The last two times we arrived early and the service was prompt and polite. But our visit last evening calls into question whether Ox and Stone was simply having a bad night or has lost some of its chefs.  On the plus side, the bartenders are wizards and are willing to recommend tequilas in all price ranges that will not disappoint. They are willing to modify the Margarita (why quality Latin and Mexican restaurants believe simple syrup is necessary is beyond me), and the drinks are well made. But there was enough salt on the rim the of the glass to clear my front walk. A hint would be nice, a salt lick is excessive and detracts from the drink since you need to carefully draw the drink from the already cleared part of the rim. The guacamole has never been a signature dish. While chunky, it is a bit bland and lacks interest. Presenting it with hot peppers is a nice touch, but needing them to give it any real taste suggests it needs further attention. And having chips made of flour tortillas takes some getting used to, and I haven&#39;t, and may never get fully used to it.  Our mains last evening were a great disappointment. My wife had the dirty rice tacos. I won&#39;t quibble, as some have, over their price. But she commented that they were flat and bland. You shouldn&#39;t need to order a side of salsa to bring a taco up to snuff, but she did need to do so. I opted for the enchiladas in mole sauce. What arrived was a slab of rubbery cheese (microwaved chewy in texture) wrapped in a flour tortilla with what seemed almost overcooked mole sauce. When the side of a fork has a hard time cutting through an enchilada something has gone wrong, and last evening my knife was an essential piece of cutlery.   The ambiance as a whole is beautiful, but do beware, as the crowd fills (we were among the early diners) the noise level goes up considerably. We sat by the window, and it was distracting to have the light in the parking lot (motion controlled perhaps) going off and on during our meal.  Our hopes to have found good Latin/Mexican food in Rochester seem to have been dashed, and we may once again have to head down to Canandaigua to find what we so much enjoy."

Our larger party was seated upstairs and our server was wonderful - very patient and kept our drinks refilled (priorities).  I ordered the Pozole soup and the Dorado. The soup was amazing (just a touch salty, but didn&#39;t detract from how delicious it was. How I&#39;ve lived my life this long without hominy is beyond me). The Dorado was perfect. A nice thin crunch from the spice rub, and tender fish. Came with rice, butternut squash and charred brussels sprouts. For the price, I was impressed with the portion size and finished dinner happy and just the right amount of full.  Many others in our party ordered tacos, and after seeing the portions relative to the price, they are robbing people blind. Three sad little tacos on a plate (all a la carte), no sides (those are extra), for the same as what I paid for my dinner (within a dollar or two). They&#39;d be smart to lower their taco prices (or increase it to 2 per order), or put them on the appetizer menu, to give people a better idea of what they&#39;re getting into. Everyone said they were delicious, so no fault of the kitchen.  Overall, top night out! Looking forward to going back again!"

The bad: The most important part, the food and the drinks, were not as keen as the decor. <br>~ Drinks: I only ordered one drink, a Mojito, it was not made well at all. Too much lime, not enough sugar cane, and barely any white rum. A very lack luster drink. <br>~Food: We ordered the ox tail croquettes, the cold cuts plate, and the steak chimmichuri. The croquettes were bland, any ox tail meat that was in it was unnoticed. The only saving grace was the sauce for the croquettes. The steak was cooked right, however it lacked basic seasoning of salt and pepper; leaving it to be bland. The chimmichuri sauce was also not the greatest, but it made up for the lack of a well cooked steak. Overall: Go for the atmosphere and visual experience and hold off on the food."

I could have just had that smoked tomato broth by itself with an entire loaf of bread it was that good! They definitely did not skimp on the portions here. At the end of dinner we were surprised at how reasonable our bill was. The service was very prompt and even the owner came over and checked on us multiple times. <br>However- after recommending this place they were unable to handle a large party in their private room. They were aware of this large party with a contract set in place 3 weeks prior to the event. The night of the event there was no manager to be found as there were no entrees served for hours! Some people waited over 2 hours until they got their dinner. It was just a bad situation. <br>After this incident I decided I would give this place another shot since I had a good experience the first time. there were flies in my beer and I will never return after having one in my mouth. I took a sip of my beer to only pull out a fly out from my mouth. In disgust I looked at my beer only to see another fly floating around in there. It was awful.

Four of us ordered the custom punch bowl ($25). We got to choose our liquor (tequila), and they made a really good punch with mint, grapefruit, strawberries, and maybe a lil white wine? It came in a huge decorated metal bowl with matching little goblet glasses that basically made us feel like royalty. The punch was strong, delicious, and seemingly never-ending. Looking over the menu, it has some interesting stuff on there. They have crickets (which they keep fresh apparently), crispy pigs ears, and a lot of Ox. A table of diners we knew said the ox tail tacos and entree were both excellent. Definitely worth trying out if you&#39;re feeling adventurous. Otherwise, I&#39;d stick to drinks, which I&#39;ll definitely be back for!"

It was super busy, but the host was willing to look for options for us and found us a high top table to sit at. The stools were pretty comfy for stools, only issue was it was in a high traffic area, but still ended up being OK because the restaurant is laid out well inside.  Atmosphere is good, trendy and loud, wide variety of people eating including families with older/adult children, couples, and a couple of birthday parties. The ceiling is arched (vaulted?) and thus the acoustics can be such that a person two tables away will sound like they are talking in your ear. Not a deal breaker for us, since we were chatting loudly anyway, but just keep that in mind. The drinks were fantastic. Over the course of the night we ordered a pisco sour, a hemingway, a yankee leaper and a night at the movies. All were really good and fairly priced for the quality of alcohol in them (of course keep in mind that these are cocktails at a trendy place and so are ~$7-9 each).  For starters, we tried the empanadas, crickets, and pig ears. Delicious. I was the only one who was brave enough to eat the crickets, but I liked them! Nutty! Our waitress was very chill and fairly attentive for how busy she was.  For main course, I ordered the pozole (AMAZING) and the Jamon sandiwch (EQUALLY AMAZING), my husband ordered two tacos (per him, they were &#34;totally worth the $5 charge&#34;, and he&#39;s a pretty frugal guy), and my friend ordered the choripan which was also very delicious and a nice portion. Of course we ordered dessert and as a result the bill was astronomical. But it was very much worth it and is very much worth a special occasion or a cocktail and tapas night.

The waiter also could not tell me the difference between traditional, verde and the mole sauce for the enchiladas, other than the color of course. That being said I have no complaints about the food, the enchiladas were good and the beans were AMAZING (slightly spicy but I prefer that). The tortillas were light and crispy and the meal was quite filling. There were many choices for tacos and we chose the chicken. When it arrived you could tell everything was fresh and it was delicious also. The only complaint was that it was the same price as the enchiladas and it was only for 2 tacos. While my enchiladas came with rice/beans and was filling, 12 dollars for 2 tacos seems a bit overpriced. Adding another taco or perhaps some chips and with salsa on the side.  The ambiance was very nice and although it was not packed it was slightly echoing. Despite the echo&#39;s we did not have to shout to each other but we could hear most conversations.

Fried crickets!  It was definitely my first time willfully eating an insect, but getting past the mental aspect I found it to be very flavorful---though I limited my consumption to just one cricket.  Additionally, their barbacoa sliders were excellent and their mussels good but forgettable.  There was a good variety of tacos, but I felt the price point was too high for just two with no additional sides.  The oxtail entree was quite delicious in sauce over a bed of egg noodles, though I would like to have seen more meat.  Drinks were well crafted but nothing amazing, short of a giant crystal bowl of sangria for four we shared for a mere $25.  I will definitely give this place another try in the near future, but not a place I plan on frequenting."

The first time I came here for dinner, we got the oxtail croquettes and the guacamole as appetizers. Wow - the guacamole was amazing, the chips they give aren&#39;t regular chips, they&#39;re like these fried pita chips that are light and feathery, and dusted with spices like cumin, salt, and pepper. The oxtail croquettes were good too, but in comparison to the great spices on the chips, it was a little bland. Could do with a sauce with a Pop. I got the chicken mole with high hopes, but was disappointed. But, to be fair, I have really high standards when it comes to chicken mole so I won&#39;t hold it against them. One of my companions got the fajitas and they were great, and my other companion got tacos which were also great. I&#39;ve been back a few times with friends for drinks.

We placed our food order and they returned with our meals 10 minutes later. I ordered and enchilada and my wife ordered 2 tacos. I felt like I got a meal and she got an appetizer sized portion.  The menu states Tacos which is plural and means more than 1. It should say Taco portion size 1 for $5.

The building itself feels like a castle and the decor inside lives up to that as well. It is so romantic feeling with warm lighting and a gorgeous bar that doesn&#39;t feel cramped, even though it was pretty full. Fantastic rendition of modern-meets-authentic-Spanish cuisine. Tried the &#34;punch with friends&#34; which is served in a huge silver antique punch bowl with mini goblets for drinking. It was delicious and the server made sure to include in it a couple of our favorite spirits that we told him we liked (St. Germain and cachaca). My friends and I shared a bunch of tacos-- shrimp, rajas poblanos (spelling?), rotisserie chicken, and baja fish. The baja fish and shrimp were TO DIE FOR-- trifecta mix of crunchy slaw, creamy sauce, perfectly done shrimp / a great fry batter on the fish. Surprisingly also good were the rajas which didn&#39;t contain any meat but had the most delicious spicy, creamy corn. The corn tortillas are made in house and were by far the best I&#39;ve had in Rochester. We also had the guacamole with spicy flour tortilla chips that I could have had as my entire meal-- limey, salty, just so good. Our server was sweet, helpful, and attentive, despite the probable (annoying) impacts of our heavy drinking on a Friday night :) Can&#39;t wait to go back to this place! There were a lot of great sounding cocktails that I wanted to try. I plan to come back for a date night soon!"

So, this time I decided to order a special and went with the rib-eye that came with garlic smashed potatoes as the starch and the a mix of green beans and Brussels&#39; sprouts. The rib-eye was delicious and cooked a nice medium rare. The vegetables were good too. The sprouts appeared steamed or boiled and I prefer mine pan-seared, but they were good and my main focus was on the protein anyway. The meal was $27. Not too bad, but I feel like it would have been a little less expensive elsewhere. I had a few Founder&#39;s All Day IPA to wash it down. Nobody in my group ordered a pizza, which was a rarity! Everyone ordered a special or a pasta dish. I tried one of my friends penne with vodka sauce meal and I think that will be my choice next time I go. It was really, really good! We laughed about being early birds since most of my friends have kids and we were eating at 6:30. Personally, I don&#39;t eat dinner until after 8-8:30. At that time the place was about half full. and easy to get a table. However, once we were done and heading out the door at 8:00ish, the place was filled. My suggestion would be to come early or call ahead and make a reservation for a later time. Our waitress was attentive, quick to make menu suggestions, and readily refilled drinks."

We visited on a Sunday night following a Fringe Fest show so it was relatively empty though we had a reservation for our group of 8.  The service was fine, pretty invisible, in a good way.  I ordered the lasagna since it is one thing we don&#39;t bother to make at home.  It was pretty darn good.  The selection of beer is kind of small given most places these days have extensive menus. Not being here on a busy Friday or Saturday I did not get to see if their hosts/hostesses have gotten better at their job - in the past they were often combative and surly when it was crowded.  I hope they have hired people more skilled at dealing with the pressure."

The thrown hath been stolen. Hear, hear for Veneto!  When a pasta dish manages to remain light and flavorful, it&#39;s a rare feat. I couldn&#39;t stop eating it. I even stopped halfway through in an attempt to save half the dish for the next day. Nope, I couldn&#39;t resist. I even sopped up the rest of the sauce with their table bread. It&#39;s a delicious balance of cream, tomato and a subtle hint of heat to round out the dish. This may be one of those places where I&#39;ll go just for my favorite dish. They have wood fired pizzas as well so it&#39;s a good place to go with a group and get things to share.  The space is a nice upgrade to the general vibe of East End and I&#39;m glad it&#39;s survived -- Likely due to the care taken to prepare and present each dish with simply good ingredients.

I think this has been done away with as nothing I saw on the menu mentioned it and I was unable to get the penne that I saw in the pictures. My family and I went together we had the arancini and prosciutto wraps along with some salads to start. Then for dinner I had the farfalle with vodka sauce.  Everything I ate needed seasoning besides the prosciutto wraps. They do not have fresh grated parmesan either which, for the cost of the dishes, I would expect. Olive Garden has fresh grated parmesan. The bread was cold and so was the butter. The salad needed more dressing, in my opinion. They must have changed the sauce when they did away with the homemade pastas because anyone who says Veneto has the best vodka sauce around is not well versed in the area. The waitress was very attentive and amiable, the only reason this review is not a 1-star. But the interior of the restaurant was cramped and very cold, temperature wise. I liked the décor and the view of the street. All in all there are much better Italian restaurants in Rochester. Maybe the pizza is good but I do not think I will be back to try."

Passable everything else.  Good location downtown. Street parking which I can usually find nearby otherwise there&#39;s a paid parking lot right next to it. Outdoor seating which is a good plus when the weather is good.  The place isn&#39;t too big but I&#39;ve never had difficulty finding seating even without a reservation. The kitchen area is right in front of the bar and you can see them make the pizza which is cool. The decor has an earthy/wooden feel which is nice.  I&#39;ve been here a few times and tried a few things. I&#39;ve discovered that all the pizzas are quite well done and taste delicious no matter which one you end up getting. The salads are hit or miss. I&#39;ve had a delicious Greek salad but a very mediocre grilled chicken salad here as well. Same goes for the soups. You get the daily special soup and that&#39;s your only option. While the broccoli cheddar soup was just what my taste buds craved (though not as hot as I would have liked - temperature wise), the 12 bean soup was just okay. The Bruschetta is decent and I would order it again.  Do try the tri-berry pudding for dessert. It was surprisingly very good.  The servers have been very helpful and pleasant every time I&#39;ve dined here. Prices are reasonable and I believe maybe a little cheaper than other wood fired pizza places. They offer gluten free pizza and pasta and allow substitutions which is a plus.  All in all a nice cozy place for a casual dinner with a nice atmosphere. Three stars because of plenty of room for improvement in most menu items other than the pizza. Will come again."

One of my friends that&#39;s a very picky eater, loved the place, so we would go often when we were hanging out. But, alas, he moved far away, and the fact that parking in that area is hard to find most days, meant, that I rarely visit this place anymore. When I went this time, now that my friend came for a visit, I felt that time hasn&#39;t been too kind to Veneto. The whole pizza in a brick oven has become quite common in Rochester, and theirs although not bad, it&#39;s not spectacular enough to be on the top of my list. Their pasta dishes seem to have become more standard too, so it&#39;s not that exciting. Although the pasta dish I had (Venetian Chicken) had an incredible sauce and delicious vegetables, the chicken I got was a rather dry and tasteless piece of grilled chicken breast. Their beer and wine selection is OK, again nothing to write home about. Then there was the service, we barely go any attention in a restaurant that had some tables going, but it wasn&#39;t completely slammed. The waitress forgot our requests a few times, things like plates and the wine I ordered. That really convinced my traveling friend that it may be a good idea to go somewhere else when he comes to visit."

I would also say that the food is absolutely overpriced for their portions and quality.  It&#39;s certainly good for what it is, but it&#39;s no Michelin Star restaurant.  They&#39;re better than most Italian places in Rochester in what they do, but they&#39;d be right smack in the middle if I were to compare them to any joint in Little Italy in NYC.  Veneto unfortunately does seem to arrogantly think they&#39;re the best in town, which is probably where the unpleasant cockiness comes from.  If the staff were friendly and genuine, and they lowered their prices a good 10-20% (especially the specials - beware of price gouging!), I would probably go far more often."

But boy was this OVERPRICED!!! $14 for a mediocre pizza that was unfilling (didn&#39;t look 12&#34; to me). For $12 you can get a regular Margherita Pizza (minus the basil). Should basil cost an extra $2? Not if you&#39;re given a scant few shreds of a basil leaf. Not if, for $13, you can get a pizza topped with sausage, peppers, and carmelized onions. Which brings me to another complaint- how on earth was this menu priced? How is it possible that having a pizza topped with a few measily shreds of basil costs more than a pizza topped with sausage, peppers and carmelized onions?  In general, the prices are quite steep- everything, including appetizers, basically costs $14 (except for a few salads and one or two pizzas). Another thing that I didn&#39;t like about the restaurant was that the service was cold. In summary: another mediocre, overpriced restaurant on the Rochester dining scene.

It remains an odd mixture of upscale and pizza parlor.  The water glasses are still plastic, napkins are still paper, entrees are delivered with plastic shakers of parmesan and red pepper flakes, and the flatware is cheap enough to bend with your hand (if not your mind).  The menu is pretty much unchanged as well.  As simple as pizza, as complex as seafood risotto, or pasta in a light truffle cream sauce topped with locally made goat cheese. At any rate, the important thing is that the food remains very good.  I had house-made ziti with bolognese sauce (excellent) and my wife had a wood-fired pizza (also top-notch).  And the service remains friendly and efficient.  Our server took the trouble to explain to us that the winemaker of the sangiovese we ordered had altered the ratio of grapes in the wine and offered up a sample before we made our final decision.  How cold we say no?  It was fine and at only $26 a bottle a steal.  The desserts as well came through.  Bread pudding with raspberries and blueberries for me and for her a tiramisu worthy of the Italian region (the one called Veneto) where it originates. The only thing that has changed is that Veneto now takes reservations.  We walked in at 7 and were told that without a reservation they had nothing for us.  But then we were invited to wait (maybe 30 minutes) for spots at the bar, which turned out to be great -  roomy, not too loud and a great view of the pizzas baking in the wood-fired oven.  Although why, I wondered, were other people (also without reservations) who came in after us not invited to wait for bar seats.  Are we just that special I said.  And my wife put her hand on mine and said yes, yes we are.  Well, that and there were six of them and only two of us."

A place like Cheer&#39;s where they will get to know your name and treat you like family."

When it comes to Rochester food blogs, the real OG when it comes to consistency and dedication is the Rochester Pizza Blog and the nameless man behind the blog, the Rochester Pizza Guy. He has been writing reviews on pizza places around the city on a regular basis since 2009 and has kept a blistering pace throughout the years that I can only aspire to. I&#39;d been admiring his work from afar for a while and found some great pizza places because of him (Fiamma and Nino&#39;s especially) and was pleased when we started chatting online after he read about my apprenticing at Fiamma. After some stopping and starting, we finally ended up meeting for a pizza dinner recently at Veneto on East Ave. Since we had both eaten there before, we were treating this as an opportunity to revisit their pizza and chat about blogging in Rochester and pizza in general. Splitting two of their pizzas made the most sense to us so we went with a Margherita to baseline the pizza again and one with a few more toppings in the Rustica. I&#39;ll cover the pies in individual sections and I think I&#39;m going to do that for pizza reviews moving forward to maintain a consistent format that makes sense and gives equal weight to each of the elements. Crust Both of our pies featured a relatively thin crust with a fair bit of chew and crunch cooked in Veneto&#39;s wood fired oven. Unfortunately that is where the positives end for me. There was little to no flavor developed in the dough that comes from yeast and time and a distinct lack of salt that left the overall profile similar to that of an unsalted saltine cracker. The cornicione (outer crust) offered none of the oven spring that comes from a blisteringly hot oven and was a bit on the dense side for my tastes. Only hints of color and char were found on the under carriage even though the top side had a bit more color than I&#39;d prefer. As the RPG (Rochester Pizza Guy) mentioned in his post, there was also some uncooked flour as well which isn&#39;t particularly pleasant. I don&#39;t think it is too much to ask to make the crust more than just a vessel for toppings since the crust makes up a significant amount of the pizza and in this instance that was not achieved. Toppings Unlike what I would consider to be a classic Margherita pizza, Veneto&#39;s &#34;Margherita&#34; didn&#39;t offer fresh mozzarella cheese or basil and instead was basically just a classic cheese pizza with sauce. To be fair the menu does not mention that basil is included, but by using that term there is a certain set of criteria that pizza fans expect including a simple crushed tomato sauce and the ingredients I mentioned above. For what we were actually served, the sauce was cooked down to an overly sweet level for me with hints of dried spices and topped with aged mozzarella cheese. Nothing appalling here, but also nothing particularly enticing either. Adding green peppers, caramelized onions and italian sausage turned the Margherita into the Rustica pizza. Usually I prefer simplicity to piling on meats and veggies, but in this case they definitely made an improvement. The sausage was pretty basic spread out in small chunks that had a similar taste and texture to frozen pizza sausage and the peppers and onions made the whole thing sweeter than I would have expected.  Admittedly this was better than the Margherita since the toppings distracted from the crust, but not a pizza I&#39;d want to revisit. Recap While the food we had at Veneto wasn&#39;t inspiring, I greatly enjoyed meeting the Rochester Pizza Guy and having a  meal with Rochester&#39;s most accomplished pizza critic. Check out his post on our experience there and we saw the pizza similarly and although I don&#39;t offer a rating with my reviews, I agree with the one he put on Veneto of a C-. I hope to sit down with him in the future for another meal and gab about the pizza scene in Rochester as it evolves! For pictures and comments please see my review at Food About Town."

The waitress tried to explain it away as due the volume of people and the open kitchen, which I didn&#39;t buy. We got the antipasto as an appetizer and were not terribly impressed. We particularly did not like the prosciutto, which was more like regular ham. Aside from that, it was very small portions of various things on a bed of greens. We both got pasta for entrées, the Rustica and Venetian chicken. These were fairly good, but nothing special. The service was decent, a bit brisk, but efficient. I felt that there was not enough selection and choices on the menu. For a menu that small, I would expect there to be some stellar standouts, but I have been here a few times and have left thoroughly unimpressed for the price every time. There are countless better Italian options in the Rochester area for every price range and level of dining experience. Save your money and try somewhere else in the the East End if you&#39;re in the area."

THEE ONLY reason that I give this place 4 stars instead of 5 is that we would have missed out on such a great dining experience had we not stopped to see if they were really open.  I googled the place on my blackberry just to see what the hours were and it said they were closed on Sundays, but my friend said let&#39;s stop by to make sure...GOOD CHOICE!!! lol We walked in and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  The layout is quite interesting.  The great part about the place is that there is an open kitchen and you can always smell the great food coming out.  The other part is that you can go fine dining by sitting to the left of the bar (that also doubles as other seating and you then can also watch them cook as well) or go casual by actually sitting and eating at the bar. Our waitress Patty was great.  We were immediately greeted by one server but ultimately were waited on by Patty.  She was pleasant, and gave great service.  The interesting part was that bc it was so cold outside that night, they were moderately busy and usually in most places if it&#39;s not too busy a server will just bug you or rush you bc they usually want to leave early if it&#39;s not busy (you are reading a review from a seasoned professional bartender/server lol) BUT Patty was great.   I had bottled water, and my friend had red wine.  I wanted a glass of Our Daily Red (a GREAT organic NON sulfite red wine), but they were out and then she was kind enough to suggest a few others, but I passed. I started out with a simple chicken soup, and it was YUMMO, and NOT too salty!  Then had a yummy spinach salad with grilled chicken, artichokes, carrots, and tomatoes, a simple FRESH salad...and THEE BEST dressing EVER!!! I even asked if they would sell the dressing!  They said no... but trust me I am going back again to ask for it! My friend had an eggplant rolatini type of dish, and an antipasto, which was amazing, and SMALL....trust me most places I go to antipasto&#39;s are usually served with a TON of lettuce and very lean on the good stuff: meats, cheeses, peppers, etc.  If you look it up in the dictionary, LETTUCE isn&#39;t even mentioned as an ingredient.  Needless to say it was incredible. As we were eating, the owner and chef were cooking but tthey were also chatting with us about the wine list and the food etc., which was a nice touch too.   We skipped dessert because we were very well fed and went to movies.  Bottom line:  great service, great food, great ambience in a nice casual to possibly a marginal upscale place and you could NOT beat the price! Just UPDATE YOUR WEBSITE!"

The sub 1-star service we received last night is perhaps a less than typical experience, yet it speaks volumes to the way this place is managed. Our experience -- party of 8 for 7PM reservation that was made a week in advance - was an absolute disaster from the start, and was mismanaged the entire way. We were treated as an inconvenience that the waitstaff did not want to deal with. 7PM: Hostess informs us that our table was given away to another large party before 7PM. Tries to blame it on other party for saying they were us. Does not apologize. And instead begins acting visibly frustrated with the whole situation. Proceeds to &#34;see what they can do to accomodate us.&#34; Again, no &#34;sorry.&#34; Next 10 minutes: Our party is trying to figure out whether to stay or go somewhere else. However, nearby options don&#39;t have tables available for at least an hour.  Hostess returns still trying to &#34;see what they can do&#34; and suggests another big party is getting ready to leave, &#34;so it shouldn&#39;t be long.&#34; Offers hasty &#34;sorry&#34; (the one and only we received) and runs off. We decide to wait patiently. 7:20PM: Waiter (different person) comes over to seat us. <br>Waiter: &#34;Everything is ready.&#34; <br>Us: &#34;Hold on, will that table seat all of us, it looks small?&#34; <br>Waiter: &#34;No, we&#39;ll have to split up your party.&#34; <br>Us: &#34;Can&#39;t you just move these other two tables together? (Pointing at two empty tables in different section)&#34;<br>Waiter: &#34;Agh. OK.&#34; (Visibly annoyed. Rushes over to tell hostess. Hostess is now also annoyed - perhaps angry.) Another 10 minutes: Hostess is now trying to move the two tables together, and in the process of doing so, is creating a scene. Most diners in the restaurant are now dialed into what&#39;s going on, as hostess unleashes anger on tables...e.g., salt and pepper shakers falling (flying) off the table, loud banging noises. 7:35PM: We&#39;re finally seated...<br>No apology for the wait or inconvenience.<br>No &#34;welcome&#34; to the restaurant or &#34;thank you&#34; for staying.<br>No comped drinks for the mistake they made, and subsequent delay.<br>Forgot to give us menus when we were seated.<br>And perhaps most discouraging was the gratuity they still automatically added to our tab.    I just hope that management sees this message and corrects things. This place has so much potential, but their staffs&#39; attitude leaves a lot to be desired. Cheers."

The food here is your typical moes. The employees were all kinda grumpy, unhappy, and sad to be around, except the girl at the cash register. The next 2 times I went though, there was a noticeable difference in service. It&#39;s a good location, but there is no parking lot.

Both times were for birthdays and it was definitely fun.  We didn&#39;t plan ahead to let them know we would need special accommodations for seating, so there was a bit of a wait for us. They set us up in a little space off the bar area which was really lovely and the bartenders were very accommodating. There was something funky about the piña coladas and they were really efficient fixing that for us.  We were seated on the second floor of the restaurant which had a beautiful jeweled screen, gorgeous chandeliers and a cute little fish tank to look at. Be warned, it&#39;s very dark in there. Most of the people in our party needed to use their phones to help read the menu.  The food took a while to get out even though I would safely say the restaurant was not slamming busy but the quality makes up for it. The appetizers were all delicious. Everything had a very Caribbean feeling about it, despite not being the most authentic food in the world. My seared tuna was a bit over cooked, but that&#39;s easy to do for a large party.  Because of the price, I wouldn&#39;t go here all the time (we spent $100 on two people between drinks, appetizers and dessert) but it&#39;s lovely for a special occasion."

The Cuban was mediocre. The pork was flavorful, but the pickles were bland and sauce almost non-existent. It was served with their plantain chips and a black bean dip. The plantains were delicious! The best thing I had! The black bean dip was just weird. No one in my party could put a finger on what it was until someone said it tasted canned. After the Cuban, they brought out paella that was, well, not paella!!! No crispy rice bottom, over cooked seafood &amp; very spicy. I love spicy, but paella isn&#39;t supposed to be spicy.

My fave is the Hemingway tea, not just because of the name- it&#39;s both potent and delicious. The pitcher is a good value given the size- you can usually get about 4 drinks out of it. The only food I&#39;ve tried there is their Cuban sandwich. I thought it was very good, but my boyfriend was less impressed than I.

Pros <br>The staff were dressed nice and looked like they worked in the Caribbean. I liked this and felt compelled to tell them so. The cocktails are super fancy and reasonably priced.  The food presentation is spectacular.  The service was exceptional The peach cobbler was more than enough to share and sooo good  Husband had cannon blackened mahi mahi. I tried a bit of all. It was awesome  My plantain chips were mouthgasmic. I wanted to eat them all but we couldn&#39;t finish!  Cons  Entrees are pricey especially for my Canadian dollar. They ranged from 20 (pork loin) to 50 (lobster tail) but mostly 25-30 I ordered the calamari (yes I went to a fancy restaurant and ordered 2 appetizers) and although it was creative (2 varieties of deep fried squid, banana pepper, artichoke and carrot) it didn&#39;t quite rock me.

Nice patio to enjoy drinks during summer months. We ordered a pitcher of rum punch. It was alright, not quite what you&#39;d typically find in the Caribbean.  It was only $19.00 for the entire pitcher and they offer several other drinks in pitchers also. This could potentially be a good thing to share with friends if coming here with a group. We saw an associate here who praised the drinks they serve, however I only tried the rum punch pitcher, which was mediocre at best.

I ordered the special fruit Mojito of the day, which was Mango-Coconut......no argument there. And my date  ordered The Del Toro, which was a cucumber jalapeño, cilantro and mint cocktail. It was to die for. Other right amount of spice, the cucumber was super refreshing. And the herbs were really prominent. I could not get over how good it was. My Coconut-Mango Mojito was really good too, nice and sweet, and the fresh mango was delicious.  And as if that wasn&#39;t enough.

The appetizer came out a few minutes after. The Bongo Pollo Drummers $9.95 - consisted of 5 small chicken drumsticks. I will say, the sauce it came with was good. I would only value that dish for about $7. The Paella was bad.  For almost $30, I expected more.  There was no flavors to it at all. Just bunches of proteins and ingredients drenched in soup.

The vibe is unique and fun, and they have a cute little cocktail/couch area in the corner that would be nice for a semi-large group to just hang out with some drinks. The bar area is large and welcoming, although probably more enjoyable when the weather warms up, since the front door is right there and when it opens it can bring in quite a draft. Service at the bar was good, bartenders were all very nice, and the food came out pretty fast. They had an interesting looking cocktail menu with some different offerings, since it is Cuban-inspired they don&#39;t have be slaves to the whisky-cocktail trend that&#39;s all over lately. Once again, didn&#39;t try any drinks personally but the couple next to us was going nuts over the drink menu so that&#39;s a good sign. I got the Cuban sandwich and if a bigger sandwich exists on this earth, then I have surely not met it. I was glad they stuck it with toothpicks, so I could be sure it was dead.... otherwise I may have been at risk for this thing eating ME. It was pretty good, though, needless to say I had leftovers. The plantain chips tasted pretty much like regular tortilla chips to me but were fine, and the black bean and corn salsa was great. I can&#39;t see coming back here too often because the menu is primarily seafood, which I didn&#39;t think about before we went, and bf doesn&#39;t eat things that swim.

The restaurant was fairly empty when we showed up (does nobody go out to dine in Rochester after 9PM?), so we had the choice of sitting wherever we wanted.  Seeing as our days were spent cooped up inside, we chose to move outside.  The outside dining area is a little odd...somewhat like a largish alley, but it was cozy.  Francois came over with our menus, and took the time to explain that the cuisine wasn&#39;t so much Cuban as pan-Caribbean.  Interesting, and worth a try.  Even more interestingly, their bar seems to have a good handle on the Caribbean, and a colleague of mine that rarely drinks fell in love with the Bahama Mama here, while I kept to the fantastic Dark &amp; Stormy. The food was, in a word, delightful.  Conch fritters for the table disappeared moments after the blue avocado was devoured, if only because it took a few moments for the fritters to cool off.  My tuna was sushi-grade, and just lightly seared enough on the outside to make it interesting - perfect.  My colleagues had a flank steak and rainforest tilapia, and the lack of conversation at the table spoke highly of the quality of the food.   All in all, I&#39;d look forward to coming back here.  Just don&#39;t expect a traditional Cuban meal, as there are many more interesting things in the Caribbean than just Cuba."

Nothing stood out and again the slight under-seasoning made them seem bland.   I ordered the paella as my entree.  I&#39;ve made paella multiple times, read many recipes, and researched the dish because it falls into my favorite-type-of-food range.  I was curious to see how a restaurant would make paella and accomplish socarrat (the toasted rice on the bottom of the pan).  It turns out they didn&#39;t try.  The paella had perfectly cooked calamari, clams, mussels, scallops and octopus.  The chicken was good and the chorizo was once again oddly bland.  Under all of the properly cooked seafood, meats and peppers, was a soupy layer of rice in broth.  It wasn&#39;t bad, it just wasn&#39;t paella and worth just shy of $30.00. My wife had the mahi mahi and in her words it was bland but there was excessive pepper heat that made her unable to finish the meal.  The vegetables on the side were so oversalted that she did not eat them.   The wine and rum flight were great.   Paying ~$60 per person or more for a meal doesn&#39;t bother me.  I know of other places where I would pay that happily.   I found myself wishing I was at them and not Havana Cabana.  I wouldn&#39;t have seen my wife disappointed and be confused by the overall experience."

My husband had the bread pudding and I had the key lime pie both were good but not amazing.  Their prices are on the high side. Parking was $5 on Friday night with $3 off our drinks, so don&#39;t forget that small red parking ticket they give you. 3/5 for food and prices. 5/5 for service and atmosphere."

I must admit I had not paid any attention to Havana Cabana, even though it&#39;s been open some time. I had made a very ill-conceived assumption (and you know what they say about making assumptions) that Cuban food was limited to wonderful sandwiches and plantains.  I&#39;m now eating my words, quite literally. My wife and I were invited to Havana Cabana to celebrate and to take advantage of a friend&#39;s Group On.  That was my first concern.  Surely a good restaurant couldn&#39;t offer a Group On could they?  Well, now that assumption is also blown out of the water.  They obviously can, and this one obviously did.  Darn it, why didn&#39;t I buy one? But back to our visit.  First of all, we visited on one of those particularly nasty evenings that we hold so dear in Rochester.  Lots of snow, bitter winds, and biting cold.  Only a fool would be out on a night like this, but when we called ahead to confirm they were still open, our call was greeted warmly and cheerfully.  Of course they were open! So on this mid-week night, there were a few other crazy souls who had ventured out to Havana Cabana.  All of us were seated next to the fireplace at the far end of the restaurant.  Cozy, yet still a vibrant atmosphere.  And the reception we received from entering and after being seated was really quite impressive.  Our waiter was absolutely outstanding.  I&#39;m writing this a few weeks after the fact so I can&#39;t recall his name but this was case where the service was spot on and the attitude and knowledge of our waiter made the entire experience wonderful.  No matter what the dish, it was described in great detail including ingredients and preparation and it was presented in a manner that wasn&#39;t formal but very intimate and with great passion.  You&#39;ve got to love a restaurant where the staff have that affection for the food and the chef. The drink menu is extensive and loaded with rum.  For me, just a classic mojito and it really was done well - not too sweet, lots of fresh mint.  A simple drink presented in a polished fashion.  My kudos to the bartender who oversees a very nice bar area at the front of the restaurant. When I first looked at the menu, I indeed was surprised.  My preconceptions of Cuban sandwiches were quickly thrown out the window.  With the fish dishes at $23 to $30, this was obviously no quickie sandwich joint.  But would they live up to the test?  I must admit that in my travels in the Caribbean and in Florida where I&#39;ve eaten at restaurants with similar menus I&#39;ve almost always been disappointed.  Such staples as conch fritters are often mealy and tasteless. Grouper and Mahi Mahi are often overcooked and overwhelmed by uncomplimentary sauces.  But not here.  Not at Havana Cabana.  I must say that the meal itself was an absolute delight. First, the queen conch fritters.  I ordered these as a test and had low expectations.  Everyone at the table ended up fighting over them.  Lightly fried, you could actually taste the conch, not just the breading.  And the sweet chili sauce was a wonderful accompaniment.  The Tortolla Beach nachos were ordered by a dinner companion as another appetizer.  Now what I would have chosen with so many other interesting choices on the menu (such as the blue crab stuffed avocado) but again, I was wrong.  If I was looking for a great bar snack with a couple of drinks, the Tortolla Beach nachos would be the way to go.  They were absolutely loaded with great black bean salsa and corn.  And not just on top, but on every bloody chip.   I was in a real quandry over the main course.  Would it be the paella which sounded so good, or one of the exquisite fish dishes.  Our waiter informed us that the paella was over rice, not with the rice cooked as part of the dish which is the Spanish version I prefer so I opted instead for the Tilapia.  Lightly coated with plantains, pan seared, and accompanied by a wonderfully fresh and sweet salsa, it was heaven.  And the sweet potato cous cous and accompanying sauteed spinach were just as good. Overall, the dish was executed as well as many I&#39;ve had at some of the better restaurants in the states and this by a little place right here in Rochester. Likewise, the pork loin ordered by one of our dinner companions was equally outstanding - tender, juicy, and NOT overcooked.  A wonderful pinkness that so many chefs overlook. The restaurant features live music and dancing later in the evening on certain nights (check with the staff).  We promised our waiter that we would return so he could teach us Cuban dancing.  I&#39;m no dancer, and normally such a promise would be false but the atmosphere and the food here are so good that this is one promise I intend to keep.  I will be back.  And with three or more mojitos in me, I might just learn to dance after all."

My friend and I started with the pineapple and blueberry mojitos. They were both very watery and not strong at all. I felt like I was drinking flavored water! After waiting almost 20 minutes, our island wedge salad arrived. The salad was the most disappointing part of the meal. First of all, the salad wasn&#39;t exactly a wedge salad (see pic). I really don&#39;t think they should use the guava vinaigrette with iceberg lettuce. The whole thing was watery and had no taste to it. The slimy mangos didn&#39;t help either. It reminded me of the chef salad the lunch ladies in high school would slap on my plastic tray!! For our entrees, my friend had the paella and I had the blackened mahi mahi. The dishes were cooked perfectly, I&#39;ll give the chef credit for that....but everything lacked seasoning and flavor extremely. Both dishes were very bland.  Overall, I enjoyed the atmosphere but I was very dissatisfied with my meal. Cuban cuisine is not supposed to be flat like the dishes I had tonight! Maybe if they made their drinks a little stronger I would of enjoyed the meal more :) Our server was very friendly and appreciated the advice we shared with him. Since they are a new restaurant, I will give them the benefit of the doubt they they are still getting into the groove of things."

I was pleasantly surprised upon entering the cozy abode. It happened to be blizzarding outside and I welcomed the warm bar area to escape for a couple of hours.  I started with a mojito ($9), which had more lime than mint mixed in. Not my favorite. For my second drink, I tried the Paloma ($10), which was a strong tequila cocktail, but refreshing. I&#39;d opt for that over the mojito. There&#39;s a little cove area in the bar too -- perfect place to hideaway with your friends. The dining room is in the back with a fireplace. Again, they&#39;re really rocking the cozy getaway vibe. Our group ended up moving upstairs for some appetizers and pizza, which is a nice area for a group dinner or a private party.  The food wasn&#39;t super authentic, but some items were tasty for sharing. I didn&#39;t try any of the entrees, but after looking at the menu, it&#39;s a touch pricey. Curious if the flavor/quality matches the price:<br>- Cinco queso pizza - LOTS of cheese. Not an issue for this lady. Goat cheese was the most overpowering of the five cheeses (a-ok for me b/c I like goat cheese, but fair warning for the non-goat lovers).<br>- Fried plantains were much like banana chips cut length-wise tossed with some cinnamon &amp; sugar. A crispy and crunchy snack.<br>- BlackBeards Pie - sweet and savory pizza. The blackberries were a nice touch to enhance pull out some of the flavors of the BBQ sauce, otherwise it would have been a touch bland. Not a total win, but a nice space to enjoy the island-vibe and warm up during the winter. Worth a visit for drinks and apps with friends."

It was rich and dark chocolate flavored with nuts.<br>~The flan was served to us by our waiter who poured rum on the top and flambeed it.  It had a crumbly light texture (versus a smooth jello-like texture), roasted coconut flakes, and a sweet syrup on top.  A little too much rum but only because the first flambe didn&#39;t light because of the fan so our waiter did it again. I tried two mixed drinks, one with coconut milk and the other had black raspberries in it.  I was not a fan of either.  Too strong and flavors didn&#39;t mix well. Even with some of the hiccups, I would give it another chance and travel to this place again to try other dishes."

The entrees were beautifully presented and tasted incredible. They seemed healthy but kept us satiated for 6 hours. My husband and I stayed for hours, laughing, eating, enjoying the ambience, the live music. Great lesser-known place to impress a date.  Pricing seemed reasonable, the Caribbean lobster was the most expensive entree and it was $38 or $39. I don&#39;t remember the drink pricing but I know four drinks and two higher priced entrees all came in under $100 total before the tip (which the waitress deserved, she was attentive but not pushy or interfering, and didn&#39;t try to push us out the door)."

It will be some time before this building houses a place that doesn&#39;t immediately make one think &#34;trashy,&#34; but there are a few things that are pleasantly charming about Havana Cabana&#39;s iteration of it. I&#39;ve always enjoyed the layout of this bar/restaurant, with the bar being in the immediate front room, the dance/dining area being in the back near a gas fireplace, and a more intimate area with private bar upstairs. It&#39;s pretty much perfect for a good party, given the correct ingredients and execution. While I would hardly expect a bar/restaurant in the East End to have authentic appeal rather than mass appeal (except for the Old Toad, but it was grandfathered in essentially), they did a nice job with the renovation and decor. No it&#39;s not really Cuban, but it is....classy and tropical. There&#39;s an upscale island feel that isn&#39;t overdone. There&#39;s potential: mahogany-hued wooden tables, bright primary-colored Island art, splashes of reds and oranges. Upstairs the plastic red vintage chandeliers toe the line between tasteful and tacky, but it&#39;s not terrible. I&#39;ve always loved the gas fireplace downstairs. Very cozy. I went as part of a private work party, but the bar and restaurant downstairs were all open. Cocktails mostly rum and juice-based. All too sweet. I didn&#39;t like any of them. But that&#39;s just my preference. They certainly weren&#39;t worth $10 in any shape or form. The food that I tasted - a bite of a seafood flatbread, a couple coconut shrimp and a small crostini topped with pulled pork - was average and doused in what people perceive to be &#34;Caribbean&#34; i.e pineapple. Actually the seafood flatbread wasnt, it was savory with some nice helpings of kale. Enjoyed it. A live Latin band showed up at 9:30pm to play some salsa and merengue music. They were awesome! My heart dropped a little when I saw that no one was appreciating them. For this band alone, the place goes from 2 to 3 stars. What an awesome free show! As for the bar in the front of the place...trashy. No other way to put it - people in sweatshirts, hoodies and baseball caps. If a place like this wants to cultivate an ambiance that suits its decor and menu price point, it&#39;s going to have to be more discriminating with its dress code. They&#39;ll lose customers initially, but there is truly no way around it. By allowing the place to be overrun in the front by sloppily dressed people in track suits and sneakers, they&#39;re sending the wrong marketing message and will never attract the type of clientele to which the place is geared. Re-vamp menu to include cheaper items more accessible to a younger crowd. Don&#39;t try to do &#34;authentic&#34; food, stick to fun island-themed twists on appetizers and small plates. Lower mixed drinks prices. Develop dress code. Market to young professionals. This place could be good. Will it get there? Unknown."

The Arroz con Pollo was terrible, it was over-cooked roasted chicken served with par-boiled rice that had some sazon in it. Neither the chicken or the rice had a Cuban flavor profile. It was so bad I sent it back.  Next I tried the Cuban sandwich. The roast pork in the sandwich was also over cooked. The bread was good, but not good enough to make up for the pork.  None of the dishes were served with Black Beans, and Pernil (roast pork) is not on the menu - a dead give away that the chef is not actually Cuban.  The conch fritters were good, but they were a bit greasy, same for the sweet potato fries, good, but not crispy, and a bit greasy.  The table next to us ordered a flambé dessert that had a plantain chip in the center. The presentation was great, until the chip caught on fire!  The guest had to blow it out, and it smoked with a glowing red ember for a few minutes! They probably need to rethink that concept.  The Sangria was fantastic, one of the best I&#39;ve had!  They also have a killer selection of Rum.  It&#39;s a very nice atmosphere with a friendly staff.  I would go back for drinks and plantain chips, but not for dinner."

The second time was a few weeks ago.  Again, we were winding down a night of celebrations, this time for our friend&#39;s bachelorette party.  We were a lively bunch but by no means rowdy.  I actually felt kind of bad b/c at that point mostly everyone was ordering waters--so I put in an order of their plantain chips for us to nosh on, and had a couple of drinks myself. This time I tried their daiquiri and it was delicious!!  Just coconutty enough!  Yum!  The chips hit the spot too.   But it didn&#39;t end there--our guest of honor, the bachelorette, needed to check off a task on her scavenger hunt--get a picture of herself behind the bar serving someone!  The kind owners humored us and gave her a (water filled) bottle of rum and she poured &#34;shots&#34; (of water) for some patrons.  It was hilarious and a great way to end the night!  Thank you Havana Cabana!  We will be back!"

We&#39;ve been to the bar for drinks and appetizers but this was our first actual meal there. The food was so so. Although nothing was bad enough to send back nothing was great either. Definitely not worth the price. We went on a Friday night and made a reservation which was totally unnecessary because the place never got busy enough to warrant it. We were also really bothered by the fact that they were playing house music through the speakers and at the same time the kitchen staff was blaring different music. It made for a very chaotic and loud environment. Stick to one music source people! Around 8pm live music was to start and I noticed the musicians even had to go ask the kitchen to turn off their music. The kitchen is not separated enough from the dining room for them to blast music without disturbing the dining room. None of the managers seemed to pick up on that.  To sum it up, go for happy hour drinks at the bar and skip dinner all together."

The drinks tasted watered down, two of my friend shared three carafes of the Hemmingway Tea and they didn&#39;t feel any alcohol in their drinks. All of the seafood seamed really small, like ones you see in frozen seafood bags. The Paella was not impressive and a lot of the food was luke-warm when it came out. A couple weren&#39;t bad but just not what you expect for $20-30 meals in Rochester. You have so many better options for food in this price range. Initially, they also wanted to charge us a $30 cake cutting fee, which was removed after how ridiculously slow our service was. They were way understaffed, and we only had a single server for our group and he was waiting other tables and ours. If you go to any well managed restaurants, large groups typically have 2 servers. He was really nice about it but this restaurant kitchen is not suited for cooking meals for more than 5 people an hour. Look at the kitchen when you go in, it&#39;s tiny.

I ordered the crab stuffed avocado. It sounded good on the menu, an avocado topped with mango salsa and micro greens stuffed with blue crab. What came out was much different. The avocado was cold and not ripe, the crab resembled tuna fish salad and was tasteless. No mango salsa and no micro greens. I sent it back and they took it off the bill.  Everyone else in my party wasn&#39;t excited by their choices either. What they put on the menu and what comes out on the plate are two different things. The seafood pizza ( toast on the menu )was tasteless and cold, the &#34;Cuban&#34; sandwich was more like a sub with tons of mayo and cheese all over it, and the 5 cheese pizza tasted like a frozen shell with BBQ sauce on it and a bunch of cheese melted on top.

They have an impressive collection of rums. Unfortunately, I ordered their &#34;fresh fruit&#34; mango Mojito.  It had no mango what-so-ever; not the slightest hint of mango. It also didn&#39;t taste like it had any alcohol. It tasted like lemonade and 7-up.  When I asked the waitress if in fact she delivered the right drink, she recited off what sounded like a memorized spiel about how fresh the drinks are and they are all made with &#34;real fruit&#34;. OK.  Don&#39;t get the mango Mojito.  The plantain  chips were interesting, but be warned that they are coated in a bit of sugar and cinnamon, which I found just slightly off-putting.  The main entries were pecan encrusted tilapia and Paella.   The tilapia was tart and a bit bland. Not really so good. The paella was ok, but not authentic.  It&#39;s way too pricey for what you get. The bar might be enjoyable for someone with a rum craving, but I can&#39;t  recommend the food. <br>The music. The paper and website list two house bands,  but our Saturday night experience was a dude playing the steel drums. Steel drums. They&#39;re great outside on the beach, not so much indoors. After an hour I was looking forward for his next break.  He packed up and left at 10:15, but the paper had advertised music until 1:30am. After we ordered, we heard the waiter apologizing to other patrons for running out of food. They had no beans! No plantains.   Another big rookie mistake in my opinion is the way they clean the tables.  The waitress sprayed down the table with an Ammonia based cleaner which stunk up the whole place. No experienced restaurant would do this, and shows they have some growing pains yet."

But I have tried the pork loin, steak, and chicken and all have been plentiful sized dishes and tasty. They are open to small changes of dishes which is welcomed by myself as I try to eat healthy when I can. That being said, splurge on the fried plantains, they are delicious!  The black bean pico di gallo served with the plantains is hit or miss though.

His excuse was that the weather had been bad and they did not get their deliveries. ?  Yes, its winter and the weather is not great, but somehow I managed to drive to, park and walk through unshoveled sidewalks with 7 inches of snow to their restaurant.  ??  The waiter informed us, gave us the reason for not having the main item we came to eat, and then walked away, without taking a drink order.  After another 5 minutes, he returned took our drink order and dinner order.  My husband ordered the mixed grill, $$, that looked good, however his only complaint was that the tails were left on rather small shrimp that were in a sauce.  He would have preferred to have the tails removed vs struggle eating them whilst they were dripping in greasy butter sauce. I ordered the cuban sandwich which arrived with burnt bread.  When I pointed that out to the waiter when he came to check on our meals, he said that is common because the bread is thin. ?  I couldn&#39;t believe it, the bread was not thin, and it was burnt around all the edges.  I would think that the kitchen could control this.   Overall, the prices are on the high side for the food served, wait staff not informed and slow. Being that they are located on a street with alot of &#34;latin&#34; competition, I wouldn&#39;t return here."

It sounds like it wasn&#39;t the first time they had to deal with this. When our food finally came out, it was cold, disgusting and tasteless. Its pretty hard to mess up eggs, but they managed to do it. Another friend happened to be sitting downstairs with her family, so when we left we stopped at their table to say goodbye. They also commented that their food was terrible, so it was not just us. This restaurant deserves zero stars, but the waitress was nice and tried very hard to keep us updated and happy so I&#39;ll let them have the 1 mandatory star."

We were disappointed that the live music was not a steel drum band but it was not a deal breaker. We ordered mimosas and conch fritters to start. Fritters were good and how do you do brunch without a mimosa?  Next we ordered the Cuban sandwich and seafood toast to share. Cuban sandwich is huge. They could serve half and that would be plenty. It would&#39;ve been better on a softer bread. It was so crunchy and there was too much bread for our liking. It comes with plantain chips and salsa which were good. The seafood toast was good. The seafood toppings tumbled off but it was otherwise tasty. We tried some cocktails as well. My husband had the monkey business martini which he said was not too sweet and was a nice mix of banana and coconut that made him think of an oceanfront tiki bar. I had the sandbar which I enjoyed more as I drank it. The garnish of blackberries and pineapple were a nice touch.

Right near the Eastman school, but on the straightaway of Main Street heading towards the political buildings, Aunt Rosie&#39;s is a wonderful addition to the lunch options downtown. It&#39;s not a cafe at all -- it&#39;s more of an upscale bistro, although its lunch prices are very moderate. The dining area is moderately-sized, with space for 2-tops and also larger parties. The decor is refined but trendy. I was surprised by how perfectly this place struck the &#34;trendy Italian bistro perfect for corporate lunch&#34; note. If you&#39;re looking for a place to take a client or have a business lunch downtown, it might be one of the first places I&#39;d recommend. We ordered the butternut squash arancini and the shiitake mushroom pizza. Absolutely delicious. The arancini was deep fried perfectly with a light and crunchy outer crust and impossibly creamy interior, complimented by house-made tomato-based sauce. Just wonderful. The pizza was also impressive. The cheese was strong but not overpowering, the crust crisp and salty and the mushrooms not overcooked. Overall an exceedingly pleasant culinary experience. The two quibbles that prevent it from being 5 stars for now: the parking situation (you have to call once you get there for them to open up their free lot...cumbersome) and the service. I think they were floored by a massive party that wanted separate checks that day, but it was on the slow side, particularly for a business-timed lunch.  Overall I&#39;m looking forward to going back for dinner. Would be a nice place to grab a bite before a movie at The Little, or a show at Geva/Eastman/Auditorium Theater."

I remembered Aunt Rosie&#39;s opened up and realized it was around the corner so I popped in to check things out. I started with the polenta, which was delightful topped with shredded parmesan and fresh ground pepper. The texture is like grits. The flavor is somewhere in between risotto and gourmet mac and cheese. I didn&#39;t expect to finish the whole thing since I had a sandwich coming, but I couldn&#39;t help myself! For my lunch entree, I opted for a panino -- proscuitto, mozzarella (thinly sliced), lettuce, caramelized onions in balsamic vinegar. Due to my devouring the polenta, I only ate half and saved the other for a late night snack (it held up quite well!). I really enjoyed the simple ingredients that all melded well together. The carmelized onions were a nice touch. Some highlights:<br>- Menu changes every 3 or so weeks based on new ingredients and dishes the chef wants to prepare. There&#39;s separate lunch and dinner menus. Lunch = more sandwiches. Dinner = full entrees like pasta and pizzas.<br>- As such, the wine menu rotates. A solid selection.<br>- Nearly everything is homemade and local to WNY region. Bread is from Baker Street Bakery. Pastas are made in-house. And, they&#39;re looking to make their own charcuterie (yum!)<br>- Italian Fact of the Day: Panino / Panini means the same thing, right? At most places you&#39;d expect hot pressed sandwiches. Not here -- they don&#39;t press the sandos. Although, they toast the bread on the majority of them. Just a heads up. ***PARKING***<br>I drove around a few times to find a spot. On street, metered parking is regularly available in that area (behind the building on Achilles St). I parked on East between Chestnut and Stillson. BUT... Aunt Rosie&#39;s owns the lot on Stillson (the one between Stillson and Chestnut -- on the right if you&#39;re coming from E. Main). That means -- free parking for all!<br>- It&#39;s keycard operated so when you&#39;re pulling up, call they restaurant and they&#39;ll open it up. If you make reservations, they remind you of this. So happy to see Paul back in the kitchen with the opening of Aunt Rosie&#39;s. It&#39;s nice to see an establishment like this open up in that area downtown. Hoping to see it thrive!"

In any case the restaurant was very clean and the interior was nothing fancy. I got the slice to go. When I took the pizza back to work my co worker noticed that the Pepperoni on the pizza curled. He commented that is how you know it&#39;s going to be good pepperoni. I&#39;d never heard that before but sure enough the pizza was great tasting.

Figuring the place would be busy during the week of Jazz Fest, and having read the reviews on yelp regarding the service, we made a reservation for dinner on the last Sat night of Jazz Fest. We arrived early and were seated promptly by a very friendly hostess who expected us and remembered specifics of our conversation when I&#39;d made the reservation.  We were immediately given waters and menus, but then it took about 15 min for a server to come over and take our drink order: a can of San Pellegrino Orange and a can of San Pellegrino Grapefruit. A few min later our server came back and told us they were out of Grapefruit, but had Lime, so we agreed to switch, and then he ended up serving us the Grapefruit after all (which was in a green can). This is the kind of thing I think most of the other yelpers experienced - the wait staff is friendly enough, but not really knowledgeable about the menu.  That said, we expected to wait based on the other reviews, and really weren&#39;t dismayed because everyone was very friendly. We were still hopeful the food would be great and it was!  We ordered two small plates and a pizza - spaghetti with roasted fennel and lemon butter sauce (cooked perfectly al dente and a generous portion size for a small plate); gnocchi (pan fried) with peas and lamb pancetta (a bit salty, but really delicious); and the pizza with green garlic and arugula pesto, mozzarella and guanciale (which was cut into 8 pieces). We had ordered everything at once, not knowing what to expect, and we were absolutely stuffed after devouring everything and cleaning our pasta bowls with our pizza crusts.  For dessert we had the chocolate budino (pudding) with chocolate ganache. Another yelper had called this dessert &#39;rubbery&#39; and another called theirs &#39;hard&#39; but ours was perfect - almost mousse-like in consistency, very chocolate-y and rich. We loved it.  We are never disappointed in the kinds of dishes Paul comes up with, and will definitely be back. Next time I think we&#39;ll stick to a sampling of small plates so we can try more things, though the other pieces and mains we saw other diners enjoying looked great too."

The food itself I thought was very, very good.  The focaccia they give you for bread is simply amazing, I could eat that all night.  A very nice garlic/rosemary/herbed topping on it and very well grilled, it&#39;s simply an awesome piece of bread.  We ordered a four-cheese pizza with arugula on it which was very tasty.  The crust was very crisp with just the right amount of smoke from the brick oven and the cheese had a great saltiness to it that really complemented the arugula very nicely.  Also got the pasta and meatballs (four meatballs came with the dish) and it was very good.  The meatballs could have been maybe a touch moister, but they had an excellent flavor and were a very good size.  The sauce had a nice kick without being too overwhelming, it tasted very fresh. The meal itself was very reasonably priced, it ended up coming to $35 with tip (no drinks), which I thought was a great deal.  I would certainly come here again, especially if they could get some outdoor seating somehow or just clean up the decor of the place a little bit more."

After driving around the block we found street parking near the Salvation Army, wasn&#39;t my first choice of where to leave the car, but it was fine. We had reservations and were seated promptly, we had a nice table at the back near a window.  Our waitress was friendly and helpful, but it was a busy night as there was a show over at Eastman and she seemed stretched a little thin, so not as attentive as you would expect.  We ordered two glasses of wine, as they only have beer and wine on the drink menu, and an order of the gnocchi to start with.  While we were waiting they brought around a large basket of focaccia and asked if we would like any, we said yes, and were given one small piece each. That was the last of the bread we got all evening.  The gnocchi came, and while it was good, it was lacking something to take it to the next level. All the flavors were muted, everything in the bowl tasted the same, and there was too much sauce.  I ordered the cavatelli with mushroom ragu, it came with house made ricotta and a fried egg. The egg was a little overdone, it had a crunchy ring around the outside and the yolk was still slightly runny, but mostly set. The ricotta was excellent, I wish there was a little more of it. The mushrooms were tasty, but soaked up too much of the flavor from the tomato sauce, which was overly acidic. There was also way too much sauce for my liking.  My fiance ordered the balsamic onion pizza. It came out hot with a nice bubbling crust. The crust was excellent, crisp and light. I thought they slightly overdid it on the amount of toppings on the pizza, too much onion and cheese.  The food was good, it was nothing exceptional. I felt it was all very &#34;safe&#34;. They weren&#39;t doing anything special or unique with the dishes, which was kind of disappointing since we loved Brick n Motor so much.  I&#39;m not sure if it was because there was a show at Eastman that night, or if it&#39;s the norm but we were by far the youngest people in the restaurant. The crowd was older, the music playing reflected the age of the crowd. I wasn&#39;t a fan of the atmosphere in general, it seems very dated and muted overall."

Boy, were we both glad we ate here. We went on a Thursday during lunch time and the place was nearly full. Although the place was full, the service was still fast and friendly :] The atmosphere/decor was nice and some what classic with a trendy modern twist--inviting to a wide range of diners.  My friend is gluten free, and it being an Italian eatery, we decided to call ahead to make sure they could accommodate us with gluten free goodies, and they could! Yahoo for restaurants that keep GF individuals in mind, and keep GF options in house.  My GF friend ordered the grouper panini special but had it served over gluten less pasta instead of on the panini. She was raving about how delicious it was! She also commented on the serving size, which was pretty big(huge- it could easily make up your next 2-3 meals) all for 8$. Not at all bad for accommodative service, fresh, delicious, &amp; creative food, all while leaving her with leftovers.  I had the shiitake pizza topped with fontina and herbs for lunch and was full to the brim with a couple of slices left over to take home. The pizza was perfectly cooked to my liking, just a little bit well done so the crust had a nice crunch. I asked for the pizza without the guanciale, and felt that none of the flavor was compromised, a problem I often face when I opt for the meatless version of a dish. Many times, a great deal of the flavor comes from the meat and I was glad that this particular dish was still delicious sans meat!  I have had a lot of mushroom pizzas in my day and this one definitely is in my top 7.  As full as we were, we still indulged in dessert: a delicious flour less chocolate almond cake with ganache and a currant jam garnish. Damn good! I mentioned before that we called to ensure GF options were available, and I also mentioned to the chef we would want dessert. The chef took the extra step to make this dessert special to accommodate my GF friend and me! This really spoke volumes to me of the type of restaurant this is and the individuals working behind the scenes.  Oh and the prices- as 20 something year old college kids, we both felt the prices were affordable, and in fact, great value for the creative and large portions we had.  Needless to say, we will be back! Now go ahead and try their delicious food, I dare you."

Aunt Rosie&#39;s is located at the corner of Main and Stillson, which for those unfamiliar to downtown Rochester, is in close proximity to the Eastman School of Music. If one were to travel to the west a smidgen further down Main Street you would find yourself in the Liberty Pole area--a much shadier section of downtown. This area is filled primarily with college students (myself included), downtown commuters, and the occasional concert-goer heading to a concert in the fabulous Kodak Hall at Eastman Theatre. Located within walking distance are some of the best dining options in Rochester: Victoire Belgian Beer Bar, Max&#39;s at Eastman Place, Java&#39;s, Tavern 58, Ludwig&#39;s Cafe, etc. etc.  The previous restaurant to occupy this space, Max&#39;s Sushi and Noodle, attempted to serve high-quality organic sushi to the local population of Rochester. Needless to say, Max&#39;s Sushi quickly turned belly up. Since I live in the apartment complex directly above this location, I was overjoyed when I saw that a new restaurant was being opened in place of the old sushi restaurant.  Fast forward to mid-December. A close friend and I decide to circumvent the cold and venture downstairs to Aunt Rosie&#39;s. Our first impression came from the sign which read, &#34;Aunt Rosie&#39;s//Brick Oven Pizza//Pasta &amp; Deli//Italian Style&#34;. What a warm welcome! At this point, I&#39;m thinking this is exactly what we were looking for. Walking into the restaurant was a joy. Warm colors, quiet Christmas music, white Christmas lights draped along the walls...I loved the decor! &#34;May I take your coat, sir?&#34; The warm mood quickly disappiated. Suddenly, I realized this atmosphere was a ruse. All evidence from the outside pointed toward a cozy and warm brick oven pizza restaurant, but its pretentiousness was rearing its ugly head before I even took my seat. I take a quick glance at the menu and my suspicions were confirmed. The choices were expensive, obscure, and over-the-top. However, I love to eat great food and wasn&#39;t concerned by the prices, so I was determined to try this place out. My friend was in the mood for pizza (that&#39;s why we came in the first place) so she ordered the &#34;Chard, Clams, Potato and Pizza&#34; between the two (yes...only two) different pizzas offered on the dinner menu. I decided to order the Sicilian Roasted Cauliflower Salad as an appetizer and the Meatballs and Bucatini for my main course.  My salad arrives and looks tasty. Although complex, the flavors came together to create a clean, textured, and nutty flavor throughout every bite. My primary concern was the use of pine nuts in the salad. Not sure if I got unlucky, but the pine nut was overpoweringly bitter and ruined the wonderful flavors of the rest of the salad. The salad contains no meat, and for $8 I expected something a bit more impressive.  Our main courses arrive not too long later. My Meatballs and Bucatini arrive in a large bowl--something I would expect to eat Pho out of. The meatballs are absolutely fantastic. They are obviously oven-baked, tender, and bursting with great flavor. The pasta was nicely al dente, unlike many Italian restaurants around Rochester. Unfortunately, the sauce of the dish was ladled into the pasta like a soup. My large bucatini were literally drowning in sauce, crying for me to help them. This was not &#34;italian style&#34; at all. Great italian dishes are always conservative with sauce for a good reason. The wonderful flavors of the pasta and meatballs were completely negated because of this egregious error. My friends pizza tasted great, but unfortunately was burnt to a crisp on the bottom. The bitterness of the burnt crust ruined my enjoyment of the pizza, but she was uninterested in sending it back. She should have. I would&#39;ve never served anything so burnt. I ate my meatballs and left a large amount of submerged bucatini remaining. For dessert, my friend and I ordered the only option &#34;to go&#34;. The experience was so frustrating we needed to get some fresh air. In the comfort of my own apartment, I found the dessert to be fantastic. Perhaps the chef&#39;s specialty is preparing desserts...I&#39;m not sure. Overall, I just have to say that I think Max&#39;s is totally off base with this restaurant. I really believed that they re-evaluated their market when their sushi joint failed, but Aunt Rosie&#39;s shows that they still don&#39;t understand their customer base. When I&#39;m looking for fine dining I will mosey on over to the famous Max&#39;s at Eastman Place and enjoy their well-prepared, similarly priced food. Considering this location is literally beneath over a hundred college students, a pretentious pseudo-Italian experience was a serious mistake. The food doesn&#39;t hold up to the price."

Pasta and fries were excellent, the panino was served cold and despite the green garlic aioli it was tasteless and the bread spongy.The real problem was coffee and dessert. coffee tasted fine, but was not hot enough and we both got a mouthful of grounds at the last sip. Chamomile cheesecake was dry, how can a bite of cheesecake snap off and fly onto the floor? The chocolate budino had a rubbery top covered with cloyingly sweet carmel sauce.

The food was good and our server was awesome. I had very little to complain about.  We had miso soup to start. It was your usual miso, but with a bit less seaweed and bigger chunks of tofu. The rolls we tried out were the Spicy Salmon, Philadelphia, Shema and Love. The Spicy Salmon and Philadelphia were your typical standard rolls but with great flavor in both. The salmon was particularly fresh in both rolls. The Shema roll was my favorite of the bunch- it was shrimp tempura topped with spicy tuna. Amazing! I would suggest staying away from the Love roll. Was underwhelmed by the flavor as well as the soft shell crab but that could be that I&#39;m not particularly fond of soft shell crab.  Whatever you end up trying at Shema, make sure it includes the spicy mayo. Their&#39;s was the best I&#39;ve ever had."

There are some things I go out of my way for in the ROC: Grandma&#39;s pizza at Joe&#39;s in Henrietta, the steamed buns at Han Noodle, spicy soybean tofu and Chen Garden.  The Shema roll is now in the list."

I&#39;ll start with the cons.  The prices are a little higher than other Japanese restaurants.  You&#39;re paying for the Alexander/East Ave location and atmosphere.  I wouldn&#39;t recommend going there with young kids.  Not just to Shema, but I don&#39;t think that area is kid-friendly in general.  Along with that brings up the issue with parking.  I&#39;m usually not so lucky to find street parking, but they have a couple of parking lots in the area that charge $5.  Also, I wasn&#39;t drawn to their limited menu (lunch - maybe dinner has more options).  I wanted rolls, but the combos weren&#39;t enticing for the pricing.  Ordering a la carte would&#39;ve been overpriced for lunch.  Furthermore, I don&#39;t recall seeing any hibachi tables so it&#39;s just sushi and kitchen items. The cons do not overshadow the pros.  Pricing and parking is expected in that area.  Shema is a trendy spot in prime location.  It&#39;s convenient to have dinner there and enjoy a night out within walking distance.  To me, that&#39;s the advantage Shema has over the influx of Japanese restaurants over the past couple of years.  Even though they don&#39;t offer some traditional menu items, like chirashi, they compensate with unique items such as Japanese fries and in-house specials.  Shema serves a decent amount of fish and it tastes more fresh than some of the other places I have tried.   I ordered the sushi lunch, which comes with eight sushi pieces and the usual ginger salad and miso soup.  The salad dressing was unique.  After a few bites, it reminded of the flavor of tuna fish.  It was more textured than creamy like pureed ginger and carrots.  It&#39;s nice to see they are not skimpy on the tofu and seaweed in the miso soup, which was filled to the top of the bowl.  There were two good-sized pieces of fish: red snapper, salmon, tuna, and white tuna.  Each piece dissolved in my mouth with a slight sting from the wasabi used to stick to the soft rice.  If it melts, it&#39;s fresh.     Service was a little slow initially, but once the food started to come out, each dish was out in a timely manner.  The owner was very friendly when she came over to chat with us as we were eating the tootsies that were brought with the bill.  As I was walking out, I glanced at a wall covered with photos of her customers.  I heard that she brought this memorabilia from her old Webster location.  She seems to care about building relationships and getting to know her customers. This place is definitely worth a try."

This gentleman was not only knowledgeable but kind. <br>First things first, this restaurant is Korean owned. I see many people are under the assumption it&#39;s Japanese owned. With that being said, it won&#39;t affect my review of the food. <br>We started off with the nigiri. We ordered Tuna, Squid, Yellow-Tail, White Tuna, Ikura (Salmon Roe), and Eel. All pieces were very tasty, but I personally would have preferred thicker slices of fish on top of more rice. We then ordered a few rolls which consisted of the New York New York, Shema, and Red Dragon. Presentation was pretty standard and none of the rolls blew me away. To be honest, they all tasted quite similar. The reason I bump this score from a 3 to a 4 is as stated before, our Waiter Harrison was just such a pleasure. I could talk to that guy for hours with that lovely smile of his. <br>I do recommend this restaurant, but I don&#39;t recommend the rolls. They sure look impressive, but didn&#39;t really do it for me. And as for the nigiri sushi, it&#39;s fresh and tasty. <br>Cheers!"

After visiting probably almost every other sushi place in Rochester (I&#39;m a big sushi fan), I decided to stop by Shema since it is close to my job. I picked up my staples- Salmon Avocado (no cucumber) and Spicy Tuna with crunches and tobiko. While the staff was polite and the restaurant nice and clean, I soon found out they are seriously lacking a decent sushi chef. For the chef they have, these two relatively simple rolls were not worth a combined $18. The Salmon Avocado roll was $7 from what I saw on the menu, and the Spicy Tuna shouldn&#39;t have been much more but I guess I got charged up the you-know-what for some stale crunches and a minuscule amount of tobiko.  The texture of the rice was unlike I had ever tasted, it was too mushy. Also, there was way too much of it compared to the amount of fish they gave. The rolls were cut horribly and the end pieces were twice as big as they should of been. I don&#39;t think the Salmon was cut correctly either. The tuna barely had any flavor and wasn&#39;t spicy at all.  I will definitely not be returning until they&#39;ve announced they&#39;ve gotten a decent sushi chef. Worst sushi in Rochester. For the best, I suggest Next Door Bar and Grill."

SAKE AND BEER:  For starters the drink menu is OUTRAGEOUSLY priced.  Sake will run you anywhere between $13.00 to $20.00 a Glass!  However, the Umeshu Sake tasted so delicious that it will make you feel like your in the country of Japan at Epcot.  You can taste the premium plums in the sake, so that alone was worth the once in a lifetime $13.00 price tag for a glass.  The sake comes from the plum named &#39;Nankobai&#39; meaning big and soft ( I don&#39;t know how I feel about that yet?).  Then I finished off with a traditional Sapporo, my favorite Japanese Beer. Sapporo is a full bodied beer that is not watered down, and double the alcohol concentration. SALAD: The salad was very sub par, and flavorless.  Besides a basic American styled salad, the dressing was the only thing that could of saved it.  The ginger dressing was so thick and gloppy that you could tell it was severely broken.  Too much use of mayonnaise in the ginger dressing. SUSHI: I ordered the Green Dragon Roll which is smoked eel, avocado, and cucumber.  The Dragon Roll was so small it could actually fly away.  According to the pictures on Yelp!, once upon a time you actually had multiple large sushi rolls to eat.  I received 6 pieces that included two huge end pieces.  Speaking of pieces, the cuts were horrible.  The end pieces were too big to fit into your mouth.  Every roll was uneven with huge chucks of rice sticking out.  Inside the roll was very little eel,  and a WHOLE lot of RICE.  Plus I had flashbacks of the gross slimy eel I saw in the non-refrigerated cooler before.  I paid $10.00 for a low quality &#34;mini roll&#34;, and could of gotten a better quality larger roll of the same kind at Wegmans.  Yelp Tip!- There is only ONE sushi dinner entree, and it comes with 6 Nigiri pieces/tuna roll. Overall:  Plain Looking Interior, Over-Priced Sushi and Drinks, Umeshu Sake, The &#34;Mini&#34; Green Dragon Roll,  Poor Sushi Cuts, SAPPORO!, Slimy Eel, and a Chatty Cathy Sushi Chef....I will not be back."

Service is great, but the food is mediocre and prices are pretty expensive for the size of the rolls. Alexander Roll - Nothing special, pretty typical roll with tuna and avocado. The spicy sauce is different than what I expected. Kind of tasted like a Koren paste of sorts. Tuna was actual tuna, but did not seem super fresh. Shema Roll - Would recommend over the Alexander. Roll itself was not incredibly flavorful, and needed to be drowned in the mayo that it came from. Green tea ice cream sundae - This is very good green tea ice cream. Comes with red bean paste and little mochi pieces. I would recommend mixing it up a bit before eating -- the bean paste is on the sweet side so mixing it mellows it out a bit. Simple and refreshing, but again, nothing to write home about."

My sister isn&#39;t a fish fan (craziness!) so she had a tempura veggie roll ($8) with added avocado and cream cheese ($2) and said it was delicious. <br>We also split an order of seasoned french fries ($6) and chicken gyoza ($4 for 4 pieces). The fries came with a special spicy sauce rather than plain ketchup. We liked the fries - they were fluffy with an especially nice crust. However the seasoning on the fries could have been stronger/spicier for us. The gyoza were good. Dipping sauce was fine but could be better (spice, scallions, etc could be added).<br>My brother, husband and I split 3 rolls and the chef&#39;s sushi lunch special (8 pieces of nigiri, chef&#39;s choice, $14). <br>The chef&#39;s special included 4 types of nigiri on a wooden board: snapper, red tuna, white tuna, and salmon. They were all standard but very fresh. Wish the chef was more creative with the offerings and mixed it up a bit! For $14 I wasn&#39;t sure it was worth it - even though it came with miso soup (pretty standard) and a small garden salad with a gingery dressing (also standard).<br>The rolls we had were: Snow White ($9), Red Dragon ($9) &amp; Crispy Tuna ($10). My favs were the Crispy Tuna &amp; Red Dragon, but my husband and brother loved the Snow White (and everything else!).<br>Crispy Tuna had tuna, roe, avocado, greens and a crispy crust (not too thick). I loved the flavors of this roll and would definitely get it again. Our waitress, Rachael, confirmed it was one of their popular rolls.<br>The Red Dragon had smoked eel, cucumber and avocado with a delicious, seasoned chopped tuna topping. Again, I&#39;d get that one again in a second.<br>Both the Crispy Tuna &amp; Red Dragon rolls had a spicy, creamy sauce that was served with them. I like it and it wasn&#39;t overpowering.<br>The Snow White had white tuna (not my fav),  crab stick, cucumber and avocado. I found it too bland, but my husband and brother found it clean &amp; refreshing. <br>I was interested in a glass of wine, but was horrified by the prices ($13 for one glass of Dr Frank Dry Riesling?!! That&#39;s more than a bottle costs!!!) so we didn&#39;t get anything but water. <br>Our waitress, Rachael, provided good service and consistent water refills (thank you!!!) even if she hovered a little too much at check time (we were splitting it on multiple cards, so maybe she just wanted to make sure we didn&#39;t need help?). She was nice and helpful sorting through the menu.<br>Overall the fish was very fresh and we will be back to try more of their menu. The pics of house-made food scrolling on the tv look amazing. We may order off that alone next time to try new stuff!"

I ordered the shashimi and a salad, and shared a ginger honey iced tea and the ika salad with my lunch companion. The ginger honey tea was lovely, but I must warn you, it&#39;s strong. I say this because I love the flavor of ginger, so I was thrilled to have such a bold tasting tea. Also, since we share it, we  were able to water it down to our taste. The ika salad is basically raw squid with daikon, some baby arugula and a generous slathering of Gochujang. Well, it was wonderful, the squid was lovely and fresh and I was suprised how much I like the texture, I had not enjoyed raw squid the first time I had it. However, the sauce was the highlight of the dish, it was spicy and slightly sweet and complex, really good. My companion asked for a side of the sauce and we proceeded to eat our main course, which for me consisted of two appetizers, the sashimi, and the green salad. The green salad was better than most places&#39; since it had more than just iceberg lettuce, but the dressing didn&#39;t have as much of that sesame/ginger flavor. However it provided a great balance to the strong flavors from the Gochujang. The sashimi was tasty, really fresh fish on a bed of daikon that had  a small amount of citrus juice, light and refreshing! However I just slathered the fish on Gochujang!  When I asked which brand they used, since the gochujang I&#39;ve had before didn&#39;t taste as good as this one, she told me they mix their own! In conclusion, this will become a new favorite for my sushi/sashimi cravings."

We shared the Mandu soup and a variety of rolls. Here&#39;s their report card: Mandu soup (3/5) - 3 chicken filled dumplings (they seemed too fresh to be from a supplier) in a chicken broth with scallions and sticky rice cake pieces. $6 was steep for the portion but if they added some udon noodles in, it would make a good cold weather meal. Ginger Honey Tea (4/5) - This was legit ginger honey tea (lots of floating ginger) but so strong. If they cut it with lemonade, this would be one epic summer drink. Maki (4/5) - We tried the Hot Snapper, Meat Lover, Shema, Red Dragon and Volcano rolls. All the rolls were good...except for the Volcano roll. It was a gamble that didn&#39;t pay - cheddar cheese does not belong on a roll no matter how Americanized it wants to be. I loved the addition to arugula to the spicy tuna roll. All the seafood tasted fresh. I thought the prices were fair for the quality of the fish. Service (5/5) - The server was extremely friendly, nice and helpful. When I tasted the gochujang (Korean pepper paste) on the Hot Snapper roll, I asked her if they do Korean dishes. She explained while the owners are Korean, they want the focus to be Japanese food. She mentioned they do run Korean food specials during the week and to check on Facebook. I can see myself coming here often. My only whine is the tricky parking situation (I didn&#39;t check if you can park in the lot behind but I thought that was for Medical Arts building residents only) but hey, that comes with living downtown!"

We sampled the Hot Snapper roll and the Tuna Temaki roll. Loving on that Korean pepper sauce that topped the snapper. Asian-style hot sauce never goes wrong. It has that subtle burn packed with the full flavor of the pepper so as not to ruin your palate. The Tuna Temaki roll was filled with arugula which complemented the fresh tuna quite perfectly. Dip it in soy sauce and it&#39;s ideal. It is a little funny eating it because it looks like an ice cream cone, but you&#39;ll get over it. I must say, I am excited about Shema being downtown as the sushi I&#39;ve had recently at other spots has been less than stellar. Truthfully, the best sushi I had up until trying Shema were homemade rolls my friends and I made at their house with sushi grade meats from Wegmans. Some say this place is expensive, I say it&#39;s worth the money if you don&#39;t want to make rolls yourself. The fish is fresh, the greens are bright and flavorful. I left satisfied after sharing 2 rolls with my bf. P.S. If they have it on the menu when you go, try the Green Tea ice cream sundae. It&#39;s topped with sweet red beans and marshmallow-like rice ball gummies. Quite amazing. Green tea is surprisingly good as an ice cream flavor. The creaminess complements the herbal tea quite well."

It is conveniently located, the staff are very welcoming and the menu is interesting and accessible. However I&#39;ve been there twice and find myself now making excuses as to why we should eat someplace else downtown, even if we&#39;re grabbing drinks in the vicinity.  If I&#39;m paying more than $30 per person for the meal, I generally have sort of an algorithm in my head for &#34;worth it.&#34; If the food is spectacular, the ambiance really cool, the drink selection/preparation amazing, the concept unique -- if any of these are stand-out, the place moves up a notch despite being average in other areas. This is simply because if my free time is limited and I want to unwind and relax with a few drinks and some delectable food, I want to make sure that I&#39;m getting the best use of my time and money. I don&#39;t mind paying for something, as long as it hits some of my criteria.  My problem with Shema is that it doesn&#39;t hit any of them, although being good in a number of areas. The ambiance is best suited for the daytime and in the summer, when the generous windows shepherd in large swaths of light and the door can be left open without regret. In the winter, there is very little to insulate you in there. And at night, the lighting and mood prevent it from being intimate or a place to settle in for drinks. One time we went, the sashimi was off in that there was still salmon skin left on chunks of the fish. This left the pieces with a chewy and tough texture and I was surprised that the sashimi was sent out to the table in this manner. The rolls are tasty, especially the hot snapper of which others have spoken. However, there are better places around town. I will say that the green tea ice cream is AWESOME and you should definitely try it if you go. I may head back to Shema once the weather warms up, but for now it falls just shy of the criteria to pull me back on a Friday or Saturday night."

I was able to get the roll of my choice even though it was not on the menu.

The guests all arrived at 7:15 and we were promptly given menus. We didn&#39;t see our waiter again until 7:45 PM.  We ordered our drinks and appetizers which did not get there until 30 minutes later. We had also never been given water despite having been asking 2 waiters multiple times. They&#39;re excuse was that there were other tables ahead of us......that&#39;s a poor excuse for not getting WATER out. We would have been happy if they had just given us glasses and a pitcher but nope. Around 8:30 we finally put our main food orders in and it came out around 9. I was not very impressed. Some of my sushi had lint on it and was not cut appropriately, the rice had 0 flavor, and my rolled looked misshapen and ugly. I was extremely disappointed and will not be returning ever again.  As a side note they only had 2 waiters on staff on a busy night....what was management thinking?"

My bf and I ordered 3 different specialty rolls and they all tasted exactly the same and like they&#39;d been sitting in a cooler together all day (tho we saw the staff preparing them).

By far the best sushi in Rochester. I say this because I&#39;ve gone to Vancouver BC many times, which is known to have some of the BEST sushi, sushi chefs, and sushi restaurants in North America. I refer to myself now as a bit of a &#34;sushi snob.&#34; The fish is fresh and well prepared. The rolls don&#39;t fall apart on you and they don&#39;t over fill with rice. The staff is extremely friendly and fast. They&#39;re willing to work with you to create a roll to your liking. The sashimi is the perfect portion. The dishes are presented in a beautiful way. You can tell they take pride in their work and care about presentation. There is outdoor seating which is fantastic for people watching. I&#39;ve brought my boyfriend here many times, he lives in Vancouver and this is his favorite sushi place in Rochester. We&#39;ve been to a lot of them. He is also a self proclaimed &#34;sushi snob.&#34; The inside of the restaurant is very nice. Not too spacious but very comfortable. They also have a little sushi bar you can sit at. Parking can be a bit of an issue but there is street parking on Alexander as well as the street right next to the building, I think it&#39;s called Gardiner Park. Sometimes the parking lot behind and the one that&#39;s kind of next to the building is open for $5 parking. It all depends on when you go. If you go later on a Thursday or Friday or Saturday night, expect parking to be a pain because of the other bars and restaurants in the area. But whenever someone asks about where to get good sushi in Rochester, this is ALWAYS my first suggestion."

There were a couple additional small pieces of meat rolled around asparagus, I believe, which was excellent but I don&#39;t know what it was called.  It might have been a Korean beef appetizer.  We also shared plates of the Hawaiian, soft avocado vegetarian and the Alaskan rolls.

I must say, my buddy and I were pretty disappointed. The &#34;staff&#34; consisted of two goobers who were hiding in the kitchen, who told us tersely to &#34;look at the menu&#34;. The man who served us looked like a bonafide back-up drummer for Alice in Chains. The dude was definitely high. I asked for a house special egg roll, and was informed they were out of this particular dish. Instead, the lovely gentleman recommended the &#34;cheeseburger&#34; egg-roll. Sometimes in life, we just do things. Maybe Freud know why. I don&#39;t know why I did, but I obliged him his suggestion and ordered this dish. This turned out to be one of the bigger mistakes I&#39;ve made in a long time. The &#34;egg-rolls&#34; were hamburger helper- filled monstrosities, in no way enhanced by the side of industrial pickle slices and ketchup given me. A part of me died after what was to be my first, and last, bite of this disaster of a dish. The bahn mi sandwich was average, as they were once again &#34;out&#34; of something, this time being the house special crispy pork which they generally used for this dish. I was pretty disappointed by the portion size, and the relatively boring flavors of this sandwich.  Eating here felt like being trapped in the song &#34;Everyday is like Sunday&#34; by Morrissey. Once in a blue moon, someone pulls off fusion. East West Cafe is doing no such thing. It is plotting no wiser a course than did Captain Smith of the RMS Titanic. This place just sucks."

On the basis of their food, I would give them two stars (will get to this), but because- as of this time- it appears that at least a few of the other reviews  may be fake, I am lowering what would have been a two-star review to a one-star review. (The reason I think some of the votes may be fake: i) high % of people with 1-3 reviews; ii) high % of people from out of town with 1-3 reviews) I&#39;ll review the food, service, and ambiance separately. Food:<br>-I ordered dumplings (not fried)- they were OK (nothing special). Doughy little dumplings filled with meat that came with a dipping sauce that tasted like soy sauce. I honestly can&#39;t tell you if these are made fresh in-house or if they are brought in bulk from a wholesaler/retailer. -Banh mi- I had high hopes for this, but sadly it was extremely bland, bordering on flavorless. I mostly tasted bread and cucumbers, not meat, cilantro, jalapeno, pickled carrots, daikon, etc. -Side salad- was OK. Sliced cucumbers, tomatoes, etc., drowned in a slightly sweet, slightly spicy dressing.  Service:<br>-Our waitress was extremely friendly and attentive. She was great. Ambiance<br>-Small storefront on East Ave. Signage is not clear. We walked past the restaurant two or three times without realizing it. -When we arrived for dinner, the front door was locked (even though the restaurant was open). -No one was inside for dinner service, except a few people at the bar (this was on a Friday evening) -Decor is minimal...I usually don&#39;t care about this, especially  if the food, service and value are good. Prices<br>-Prices would be reasonable if I had a more favorable impression of the food. Verdict:<br>-Interesting concept- mixture of many different cuisines. But I think the execution falls flat...Vietnamese, Russian and Middle Eastern cuisines are all verrry different from each other and require very different skill sets with regard to cooking technique, preparation, ingredients, etc."

I just wish that we knew there were only 2 egg rolls and 2 spring rolls so we could have ordered more at the beginning.  They were out of a few things and I&#39;m hoping that they were so popular during the week that they ran out now! The server and all the people that worked there seemed very nice. I hope that they are successful!"

Although it&#39;s claimed to be a tiny bit spicy I did not detect any spice at all, and I&#39;m already squeamish with a dab of sriracha.  Currys apparently were good too. Their coconut mango sticky rice was disappointing though. The rice was a little starchy and not that authentic. Oh well at least their food is decent.

Somehow, he heard about this new Asian fusion restaurant and we decided to check it out. One of our favorite restaurants in town is Chakara, a similarly Asian Fusion themed restaurant. We were hoping that Shui would be a good and closer alternative to the Fairport restaurant. Shui is awkwardly situated just inside the Inner Loop along Main Street. It&#39;s very easy to miss as the restaurant has no clear outer signage. It also looks like Shui&#39;s location was a former fast food restaurant, which was a little disheartening initially. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find a nicely renovated interior. We ordered the Beef Satay and Thai Spring Rolls to start. The beef was more on the well-done side and ended up being a little chewy. The accompanying peanut sauce was good with just the right amount of sweetness. The Spring Rolls were the highlight of the meal for me. Tightly rolled and perfectly deep fried, they were delicious! Not one bit greasy either.  I also ordered the Green Papaya Salad which was a huge letdown. The papaya itself was okay, but the sugary dressing that came with it almost made the dish inedible. No amount of lime juice could cut the sweetness. Shui would be better off using 1/4 of the sugar or maybe even leaving it out altogether, It was also missing a depth of flavor that I could not pinpoint. Maybe a little more fish sauce or chili?  For my main course, I ordered the Mee Gar-Thi and my buddy got the Chicken Pad Thai. My dish was advertised as spicy Coconut noodles served with mixed vegetables, shrimp and chicken. It came recommended by the waiter. Unfortunately, this dish was also a disappointment.  It was more edible than the papaya salad, but still overbearingly sweet. I could not taste much coconut either, which also threw me off. The sweetness overpowered the taste of the individual elements, including the protein (shrimp and chicken) and also the vegetables (green &amp; red peppers, onions, carrots and mushrooms).  The noodles were cooked nicely though with good springiness in each bite. There was also a good amount of heat to the dish. The portions are good-sized and the prices are affordable. The service was pretty average considering we were pretty much the only ones there.  Overall, Shui&#39;s dishes were too sweet for me. It was very one-note and there was no subtlety in flavor. I&#39;m not sure if the chef that day was heavy-handed on the sugar or if it was just an off-day. It seems like their definition of fusion means adding sugar. Regrettably, I don&#39;t think I will be back."

That was my hope. The food was far away from being Thai. Matter fact, it&#39;s even worse than The King and I(which is run by Chinese crew). Tom Kha, for instance, they should have used fresh chili peppers, not hot oil(which is used in Chinese cuisine). Poh Teak is a soup that suppose to taste like Tom Yum can use lots more herbs(Kafir lime leaves, Galangal, lemon grass). It instead tasted like a clear chicken soup. Definitely was a two stars. Servers are actually nice and pleasant though. Let just please don&#39;t call that Thai food. I&#39;m not even picky, but it really bugs me! I don&#39;t think I&#39;d go back, sorry."

Delivery time was about 1 hour, not unreasonable for a Friday night.<br>I wanted to try a few different dishes that I am familiar with to compare to some other Asian/Chinese/Thai food that I have tried in the past.   I ordered the shrimp pad Thai for $8.95 - not a bad price but there was very little sauce and it was relatively bland.  I am used to a much more pronounced flavor which is what I love about Pad Thai. There were approximately 8 small shrimp and very little bean sprouts and peanuts. It was mostly noodles that were stuck together and dry. I was missing something - although the line did make it a little better. Not the worst I have ever tasted but The King &amp; I, Esan &amp; Pattaya all have them beat.  My girlfriend ordered from the Chinese menu - shrimp with sesame sauce. The shrimp were not very well cleaned (I have found this a lot in breaded shrimp so not out of the ordinary) and the breading was limp and not crisp. I believe this was a result of condensation on the inside of the plastic container - it could possibly be better when served fresh. The serving size seemed small to me for $10.95 and she said the rice didn&#39;t taste like jasmine rice to her. I also ordered the Tom Kha Gai and specifically requested to have it mild.  It was inedible as far as I am concerned. It was out of control spicy - probably a 9 on a scale of 1-10.  It was separated and basically looked like a container of chili oil with a very small layer of coconut milk on the bottom with 2 small strips of soggy chicken and no veggies or ginger. I mixed/shook it several times trying to make it better to no avail. We also ordered the fried banana for dessert - it was soggy, a strange color and the sauce that comes with it came spilled all over the bag.  The description did not match the menu either. It was 1 small egg roll wrapper cut in half and fried with a 1/2 of a banana inside.  The only bright spot of the meal was the Pla Muok Tod (fried breaded calamari strips) -- the calamari was fresh and tender and the dipping sauce was tasty (although I&#39;m pretty sure it came out of a jar because I have the same thing in my fridge) the breading was soggy but again I&#39;m sure that was because of the plastic container it was served in. I think that would be delicious fresh.  Overall this meal was not worth the $50 I shelled out for it and I probably wouldn&#39;t give it another chance. I&#39;ll stick Stick to The King &amp; I for Thai, Sea for Vietnamese and I&#39;ll leave fusion for another time."

We ordered takeout from here last night. Delivery time was ~50 mins which was fine for Friday night and on schedule with what they told us.  Brother, husband and I ordered several dishes to share.  We started with the dumplings which others raved about. They were perfectly cooked and good flavor. They had a flavor that was familiar, but we couldn&#39;t put our finger on it. Dipping sauce was ok, but a bit off and too sweet for us. Then we had the beef skewers which were amazing, juicy, super tender, and came with a delicious sauce. They also were perfectly cooked on a gas fired grill that imparted delicious grill flavor.  I would eat them daily if I could. We also had the pad Thai, which we don&#39;t believe is the best in Rochester as it started kind of bland.  It did have good quality noodles and tiny shrimp on it that came standard. It was better when the lime was added for my 2nd bite. Side note: when presented with the choice of lime served with Asian food, we have decided to ALWAYS add the lime. In 100% of dishes sampled so far it has been better with the lime.  Then we had the spicy coconut soup - DELICIOUS. They really know how to do the heat just right. We would definitely get that again. My brother even loved it and he isn&#39;t normally a &#34;soup person.&#34; Finally we had the coconut noodles with basil &amp; chicken. It also came with green peppers &amp; mushrooms which were perfectly cooked - not too soft/rubbery, which is a feat for takeout especially. They were AWESOME. Again - perfect level of heat. The noodles, again, we&#39;re perfectly cooked and not overdone. They used the nice big round noodles, which we loved. Overall a very enjoyable meal. We&#39;re looking forward to trying more from this place. Also we are THRILLED they deliver!!!! We bumped it from 4 to 5 stars just for that! =)"

I was pretty excited to have my delicious thai food once again, but instead was very disappointed. <br>In the delivery order I specifically said to go to the side door as the front door is not our entrance to the apartment. They showed up at the front door, ok no huge deal but then I asked if my chopsticks I also asked for were in there (this is the only asian restaurant that doesn&#39;t provide them unless requested.)  The delivery person, who I&#39;m assuming was new, stuck his hand into my bag of food and begun searching for the missing chopsticks. I said that was enough and took my food inside.<br>GT chicken was not crispy as per usual but instead very rubbery.  My shrimp thai basil fried rice has only a few shrimp and I ask for it extra spicy. Instead of cooking the spices into it like they have the last 20 times, they just gave me a little ramekin of spices for me to sprinkle in there. None of this was consistent with what I&#39;m accustomed to. I expect my food to be made fresh and if I want some spice thrown in there, it should be cooked in.<br>I will still order from Shui and give them another chance, I&#39;m really hoping this was a fluke!<br>P.S. Stop wasting paper and menus by stapling them to every bag, if we are ordering through grubhub we clearly have your menu."

First: Grubhub wouldn&#39;t let me order for delivery, but after calling, he said I was within the delivery radius, so he set me up! This is *much* appreciated! (especially living in Irondequoit where delivery options are limited) I had the tom kha gai soup, which is one of my favorites. This was more red of a soup than I usually see, but on tasting, it was just spicier, with the rich notes of ginger and lemongrass, and I actually appreciate that those elements aren&#39;t all fished out of the finished soup! The little dumplings? perfect. they&#39;re more like little purses of flavor, my shrimp were intact, rather than a mushed together ball. Also, the sweetened coconut rice with mango - you get such a large portion for such a cheap price! To the other reviewers of Thai cuisine, each touting their particular affinities and expectations based on their previous interactions with Thai cuisine - I take most reviews of Thai food in upstate new york with a grain of salt because what the majority seems to like is something more like Chinese take-out, than Thai. I&#39;m looking at the syrup-y choices of Phuket, Pattaya, and King and I.  Most Thai dishes are meant to be customized to one&#39;s individual liking, and I think it&#39;s unfair to downplay anything for being not exactly the way you like it - In Thailand, noodle carts give you condiments to alter those flavors of a dish - the salt, the sweet, the sour, the spicy. When I order Thai, I expect to do this to mine as well. The loveliest thing about Shui is that it&#39;s not a syrupy mess, and I took the coconut noodles, and adjusted them to my preference. Finally, a Thai place outside of the NYC metro area that put a smile on my face!"

Main St. The outside has been painted a nice cream with lime-green trim which definitely makes it stand out in this decidedly gritty area.  As you enter the vestibule you&#39;re greeted by a floor to ceiling picture of some vague Indian palace scene. Walk through the vestibule and you come to a small, carpeted dining area decorated with Tibetan knick-knacks and prints. The muted color scheme and lighting give the place all the charm of a suburban doctor&#39;s office. The chest-high counter that serves as the cashier&#39;s station coupled with ambient music (peppered with the vaguely Franco Viet vocalizations that are so popular with restaurants of this type) serve to emphasize this atmosphere.  The menu is a mix of Thai and Chinese cuisines including the perennial favorites of fried tofu, pad thai, thai basil fried rice and beef with broccoli.  I was pleasantly surprised to see mint fried rice as I don&#39;t normally see that on Rochester menus.  But I wasn&#39;t in the mood for mint today. Being that it was a little cooler than usual I decided to try the Tom Kha Gai (spicy coconut soup.) Tom Kha Gai tends to suffer from either too much ginger or coconut milk. Shui Asian Fusion does it exactly right. The rich broth was a perfect vehicle for gobbling up healthy hunks of chicken and mushrooms. The lime juice pulled everything together. I didn&#39;t stop slurping until my nose hit the bottom of the bowl.  I chose as my entrée the Kwyatio Pad Gai (thai chicken coconut noodle) from the lunch specials menu. This dish was a fine contrast to the soup if you like sticky sweet, al dente noodles with overcooked vegetables. The chicken saved this dish. Overall I think it could be executed better.  The service was fast and efficient; with good reason since there was only 1 other table seated. It&#39;s barely been 3 weeks since their grand opening. Incidentally, they&#39;re offering 20% off for a limited time. Will I go again? Yes. This place has promise. I&#39;d like to try the more traditional Chinese entrees. It&#39;s also nice to have an Asian restaurant in this part of town that isn&#39;t necessarily catering to tourists. (You know where I&#39;m talking about.)"

Depends on your taste and quality of your materials, the paste plays a great role in its flavor. It&#39;s really important that you fried the paste with high heats and bring all the ingredients alive. The curry they presented however, it&#39;s like 95% of coconut milk with some green veggies. Their green curry ... is far from best in town. I don&#39;t think I will go again."

I read the other reports and was encouraged to try them, it is very close to my house.   First, the summer egg roll, Po Pia Sod, was wrapped in a skin meant for making a deep friend eggroll, not cellphone noodle wrap. What was inside was fresh and the brown dipping sauce was good. That was probably the highlight, the insides pulled out and dipped in the sauce/ The spicy seafood soup, Poh Taek, was not spicy at all, and had very little flavor and a few pieces of overcooked shrimp and octopus. The broth was nearly like heated water, no other veggies, chiles, or flavor.  The shrimp was so overcooked it was mushy. The main course, the curry, Massamum, was so watery it was nearly soup itself. And it lacked the complex and overlapping flavors of a good curry. The shrimp were overcooked, and the only other ingredient was what I believe was think slices of bamboo, or it could have been onion, regardless, it was horrible.  If just one dish was poor, I would try again, and then write a review, but this was so bad, laughable really with the summer roll casing, I will not try it again."

I had the Mee Gar-Thi (Spicy Coconut Noodles) with chicken, shrimp, pepper, mushroom, bean sprout and basil. The taste of coconut was subtle, with just the correct amount of &#34;spice&#34; that gives you that little kick of heat in the back of the throat.  It could have used a tad more salt and there was no salt on any of the tables.

The drinks are fine and they have a decent beer selection. This place is really big and they have outdoor seating in the warmer months. None of us were really starving so we, decided to all get a salad and split a large pizza. We all had the grilled romaine creaser salad. IT WAS AMAZING. Everybody loved it. They lightly grill a romaine heart, toss it on a plate with the normal creaser toppings and some amazing salad dressing(which has a bit of a kick). The idea of grilling lettuce might not sound good but believe me its delicious.  We also ordered the chicken pesto pizza, it was alright. The dough was really thin which I usually like but I just don&#39;t think it was cooked long enough. The dough was a bit soggy and really had no texture or stiffness to it at all. The toppings were good, but it was very hard to eat. Maybe a bit to much pesto? so? would I return? I like the general feel of the place. Parking is easy, and the service was decent especially at the bar. So, probably, yes I would. Would I order a pizza again? Absolutely not. Maybe ill try and entrée next time."

I didn&#39;t eat the food, so I can&#39;t speak to it&#39;s quality or otherwise.  They have an okay beer selection, your typical options - I was happy to find a porter and the Kind IPA . The layout of the bar area (which is where I was herded to) is essentially a big square room with the bar in the middle and tables lining the walls. This room gets beyond noisy. Deafeningly loud. Not sure if there was music or not, I couldn&#39;t tell over the sounds of people screaming to communicate with one another. I was the driver that night, and they have complimentary valet, which is nice! However, when I gave them back my valet ticket they not only couldn&#39;t find my car, but they made zero effort to hide their panic about it, haha. To be clear, at no point was I concerned; where could it have possibly gone? - but maybe next time don&#39;t let on that you can&#39;t find it. Not everyone is going to be super chill about misplacing their vehicle.  The porch is beautiful, so maybe I&#39;ll try again on a weekday (in the summer) for lunch or happy hour.

Great location for a fun date night with the mr./mrs. You will find a more mature crowd here as opposed to other locations along East Ave., which is nice because let&#39;s face it, we are all getting a little older and it&#39;s getting harder to blend in with the 20 something&#39;s. I digress.  The remodel is nothing short of gorgeous and even features a party room on the other side of the building.  On weekend nights the large bar is packed to capacity and it can sometimes be a little difficult to place an order as bar flies never leave their post. There is a great patio, equipped with a fire pit and heated lamps. It has a prime view for East Ave. people watching on busy evenings. Food &amp; Drinks:  I scoured their menu prior to our visit in search of vegetarian options. Their overall menu has some fairly interesting options, but is fairly small compared to neighboring establishments. For drinks we chose the city grill margarita and electric lemonade. For dinner we ordered calamari, the eggplant stack, the house salad and the lollipop wings. The food was excellent. We were pleasantly surprised by the large portion sizes. I&#39;d totally order my meal again. The only complaint that we had was that the calamari wasn&#39;t up to temperature.  The following week I returned with my bestie and we got pomegranate martinis and hung out on the patio.  Had the best time just hanging out there also. They were not on the menu, but they were absolutely amazing.  Parking:  Free valet is offered until 10pm which can be desirable for those looking to hang out on East Ave. during busy weekends. This is also cool because neighboring lots are charging at least $5 per vehicle. If you are going on a busier weekend and intend on taking advantage of free valet parking, I recommend that you arrive early and request that they park your vehicle directly in the connecting lot. Otherwise they park overflow cars on Prince Street. I&#39;m not sure if this is an unmonitored lot but if you&#39;re particular about these things, just note that prior to utilizing their services. Dress Code:  Reviews for City Grill are currently all over the map and there are various reasons for the wide range of experiences. Several people site dress code as an issue. We did witness the patron from another party complaining that he was told that he had to leave after completing his meal because his sneakers were out of compliance with the dress code policy. While I understand that City Grill has a specific code to adhere to for its patrons, I do think that it is in poor taste of the business to ask a customer who patronized the business for dinner service to be asked to leave after he finished his meal because he was wearing sneakers. Several other reviewers have noted dress code issues with City Grill. Anyway,  save your tennis shoes for another day and keep it classy when dining here.  Overall, it was cool and I will be returning."

The 3rd time they gave away our table the last person was walking through the door, so we did kind of flip at the hostess, who ended up seating is immediately. Maybe we were just really hangry too.  I&#39;m pretty sure I got sick after having the tuna tartare. As soon as they put the dish down in front of me, I began to question the freshness of the tuna. It looked a little....rotten. But I ate it either way :/ The portion size was reallllllly small for what they were charging. And those measly little lettuce leaves were not enough.  The carnivore pizza was not bad, and the large pizza was big enough to share between 2 people. Nothing to write home about but the crust was pretty good still.  Been to the bar a few times at night to hang out and have drinks and it&#39;s pretty classy for Rochester I guess.

I got a very nice burger, 1/2 rib &amp; 1/2 chuck, so said Aaron ( he was well versed with the whole menu) ...tasty for sure but WELL DONE.

Here are five facts about each experience. Lunch at City Grill. 1. The patio is spacious and well-appointed, and is a comfortable place to eat on a beautiful summer day in Rochester. 2. The burger is quite tasty, as it should be if you&#39;re going to sear the name of your restaurant into the bun.  3. The fries are good, and the tater tots are better. Although, I would liken them more to potato puffs than tots, as they are lighter and fluffier than traditional tots. I believe they also have a set number of tots you are supposed to get with each order, because at one point during our meal our server brought out a dish of two lonely tots because apparently one of us didn&#39;t get as many as we should have. They made tot amends.* 4. They will give you a gigantic mason jar full of pickled veggies for $5.** An excellent buy. Especially if you have eight people with you, but even then you still won&#39;t finish them all.  5. I would probably come back.  Drinks at City Grill on a Weekend Night. 1. The door is absurd. They arbitrarily dismiss people for dress code violations that are evidently not violations for others, and turn away others for no reason whatsoever. I suppose the sheer randomness of their discrimination is better than if it was racially/socioeconomically motivated, but I&#39;ve been to Manhattan nightclubs that were easier to get all my friends into. 2. It&#39;s packed. Wall to wall people on the patio, so much so that you will most likely be unable to make it to the bar to purchase drinks. Which is OK, because... 3. ...They seemingly had no problem with our entire wedding party swigging from leftover bottles of Johnny Black on the patio. Maybe they didn&#39;t see it happen, but they still had no problem with it as far as I know.  4. Purse booze is cheaper than bar booze.  5. I would probably not come back.<br>______________ *This is the most I&#39;ve said tots, ever.

We were Teflon, and these men were the annoying scrambled eggs that stuck to us anyway. Ugh. Not really the fault of City Grill, but I have heard this is exactly the type of thing that happens here. We were warned, we didn&#39;t heed, so now I pass the knowledge on to you and bid you good luck with that if you come here for a girl&#39;s night. The drinks were spectacular, though. I actually got a mixed drink here, a cucumber martini, and it was so good I ended up ordering it again the next time I came in. For a non-cocktail fan that&#39;s huge. The other occasion was very different. We came in around 1 for lunch the day before Valentine&#39;s day, there was no wait and the bar area was pretty busy for a lunch crowd but nothing crazy, we sat in the almost deserted dining room area and it was really nice and relaxing. Our server was great, and very professional. Bf got something that looked like chicken french and liked it. I got the specialty pizza for the day, mushroom and lobster on a white pizza, I also loved my meal but maybe because of the white sauce it was a little greasier than I normally eat... and I normally do eat pretty greasy stuff, haha, so the cook might&#39;ve been a little liberal with the olive oil. We had a big warm cookie and ice cream for dessert and it was delicious. It was one of those desserts you pretend to peacefully share with your significant other, but it&#39;s actually a secret mini war going on. Who gets the last chocolate chip? The last scoop of ice cream? Oh, we will see who wins these battles. Dessert wars only happen with the best desserts, so good job, City Grill."

As we were ending the night, my friend needed to use the restroom and I was going to get one more light drink for the rode. I was stopped by the bouncer if you want to call it. I prefer arrogant, stuck up racist undertones douchebag. I gave my ID without even asking as my friends walked in ahead of me. The bouncer proceeded to state they have a business casual dress code. I looked dead in his eyes and said I am wearing business casual..black harem pants, black dress shirt with zebra wedges.  He proceeded to state the dress code, looked at the other bouncer, who stated, nah..she&#39;s fine. I am a brown skinned Latina who is larger than most people so I know that my clothes and my attitude and my demeanor must have turned this bouncer off as he proceeded to state jibberish about the dress code. I walked past him after he gave me back my ID. I asked the hostess if I wasn&#39;t following dress code. She said I was and I said thank you and proceeded to state that your bouncer doesnt. She asked if I wanted to see a manager. I did because it was unacceptable. Jason, the manager apologized profusely but the damage was done. Humiliation,.discriminatory actions are what you looking for as a poc going to this place, you got it. Never entering this place again. A shame because I enjoyed the special watermelon salad and Manhattan I ordered."

The mushroom pizza had a hearty helping of mushrooms and cheese but I got tired of chewing the crust.  One of us ordered desert for dinner and thought the stuffed french toast was drowned in sauce, the Nutella seemed to be cut with powdered sugar trading some of it&#39;s flavor for just sweet. Chicken cutlets were well crisped and tender but lacked flavor, contrary to the very bitter radicchio and arugula it laid on. The meatball sliders were tender, lightly sauced and between toasty bread rounds. Their muncher also thought they could have been more flavorful. All in all some of the dishes were lacking flavor or overwhelmed with just one flavor but that&#39;s a matter of opinion,  they were all well cooked and reasonably priced."

City Grill was slammed. I was beyond hungry and knew there was no shot of getting a table so we slid in at the bar after a couple left. We ordered two glasses of wine -- affordable in my book: $7-9 for a decent sauv blanc. I also ordered the grilled cheese meatballs bites, which were quite decadent. It comes with three mini-sandwiches. I enjoyed them, but I also scarfed them down since it was a little awkward trying to eat something saucy and greasy with a stranger 2 inches from me. The vibe reminds me of Char/TRATA. Lots of dark wood, leather, and recessed LED lighting. The bartenders and servers were rocking the old school look with white button downs, bow ties and suspenders. The bar chairs are super comfy too, which is a plus because normally they aren&#39;t. The bar is open with those huge windows in front and exposed brick walls -- I just wish there was a better view than the traffic that clogs the corner of East and Alexander. They have a nice patio too on that corner with a fireplace. Worth checking out in the summer.  While it wasn&#39;t all bad, it wasn&#39;t a spectacular experience. Mostly for the crowd. Not my scene. Think: Jersey Shore. I also witnessed a man tell a younger woman that she couldn&#39;t catch the attention of a bartender get a drink because &#34;he was there first.&#34; Then pushed his chair back so she couldn&#39;t get in. I&#39;m sorry, but when a bar is crazy packed, you kindly let someone grab a drink so they can get in and out quickly. So we let her squeeze in by us to order her drink and head to more friendly pastures. All in all, I wasn&#39;t into the clientele hanging out that evening. But, I&#39;ll have to go back and re-eval on a regular night and also try the full menu."

Not a cheap dinner but excellent service and the food was great. Right on East Ave. with a great view of the surrounding streets from many seats. First, we were seated and apparently forgotten. Eventually we flagged someone down. The waiter came over and apologized. Then the manager came over and apologized. Then the waiter came back with our drinks and said these are on us. We weren&#39;t angry about being forgotten and we didn&#39;t make a big deal.  We didn&#39;t ask to speak to the manager it. It was just a classy thing they did and any good restaurant that prides itself in customer service should act like this. The waiter was checking in with us quite a bit but not annoying.   We had an artichoke bowl appetizer. Several artichokes french served in a cut out bowl covered in cheese with pieces of bread around it served hot. Really rich. So good.  We both got burgers, hers was a special, mine was a standard. Their burgers are massive (10 oz) and cooked to order. their shapes make it look like they&#39;re hand made, which I&#39;m sure they are.  Great experience. I&#39;ll be back."

There was a huge TV on one wall that we will certainly take advantage of next time. Bartenders were gracious and efficient. The appetizers they passed around were amazing. The &#34;White Castle&#34;-style sliders with their logo stamped on the top of the bun were freaking delicious. I had to have 2. A really nice tiered cheese table had all the guests sampling, plus they brought out a variety of thin crust pizzas that went like hotcakes. I can speak to the hospitality and atmosphere by saying some of our high profile guests stayed for several hours rather than a polite making of the rounds. A go-to location in Rochester.

We were seated in the bar area and it was pretty loud but we didn&#39;t mind too much. It got pretty packed around 5:30/6 so if you actually want to hear each other well, I would suggest asking to not sit in the bar area. Pretty diverse crowd of people which I appreciated. Our server was ok but was very robotic and disengaged. I felt bad asking him for things because it seemed like it was a chore for him when I did ask. He wasn&#39;t unpleasant, but he definitely wasn&#39;t pleasant haha. We started with the grilled cheese meatballs which came out quickly. I wasn&#39;t hugely impressed..the meatball was very tender but it wasn&#39;t hot and I didn&#39;t understand why it was called grilled cheese. We went on to share the beet salad which was delicious!! I wish I would have just had that as my dinner. I ordered the chicken pesto pizza for dinner and I was mad I did. I asked for red pepper because it was so bland and wished I had asked for salt and pepper too but didn&#39;t want to bug the server again. It was super oily, the oil was literally pooling under the pizza and making the crust soggy. My friend got the meat lover one and really enjoyed it. I ordered an espresso after dinner even though he reacted like he just wanted to be rid of us. He didn&#39;t give me any sugar and I didn&#39;t want to bug him again so I just drank it black. Also tried a few different glasses of wine (having to ask for the wine menu back because he keep taking it) and didn&#39;t care for them. I probably should have selected from the bottle menu because they had better wine selections. I&#39;d probably come back and try it again. It wasn&#39;t horrible, it just wasn&#39;t great."

I have NOT yet dined here in the restaurant.  Atmosphere:<br>Absolutely BEAUTIFUL building inside and out. Love the modern decor and fun ceiling lighting. The room that we had cocktails in as well as the ballroom was a bit on the small side for the number of people who attended the event. Not sure how large our group was but I was a bit claustrophobic at times. Wouldn&#39;t recommend for very large parties (guessing at least 200???). Would be GREAT for smaller conferences, bridal showers, etc.  Food: <br>Cocktail hour included a variety of pizzas and a huuuuuuuge antipasto display. Food was good and my drink was strong. No complaints! During our seminar, we had their grilled cheese meatball sliders, spinach and artichoke stuffed mushrooms (OMG! So good!) and breaded chicken on skewers. Interested how their menu items are. Service: <br>Valet parking was nice. How fancy! Due to the crowded room, the bar line was quite long, even with 3 (very handsome) bartenders were working. I was impressed that I was ID&#39;d. Some places don&#39;t regularly ID people. Granted, I am 32 but have a baby face... The bartender wouldn&#39;t take my coworker&#39;s validation of my age, I had to get my ID out. So I&#39;m thinking this place won&#39;t get in trouble with under age serving if they keep up with this!!! There were also numerous servers to clear away appetizer plates during seminar breaks. All in all, my experience here was GREAT. Like I said, I didn&#39;t dine in the restaurant. Wouldn&#39;t mind seeing how that is too. I was kind of disappointed to see the low rating and the poor comments. I know one of the owners and it saddens me that such a beautiful place is getting negative remarks.

Every bar at this location prior to City Grill was tacky, but this new restaurant is spacious, tasteful and full of natural light. The bar is huge and partly outdoors and the patio provides bird&#39;s-eye views of East Ave and Alexander St, a great place to people-watch on any summer night. The beauty of this place pretty much ends there. The hostesses emanate an exclusive vibe, not an accommodating, warm or welcoming one. They quoted us a half hour for a table and we waited about 45 minutes, re-approached the desk, and were then seated hastily, as though they&#39;d forgotten about us or had no specific plan. The service was also abysmal. By the end of the night we were forgotten by our waiter, who was apparently the victim of a front-of-house manager who cut the number of servers down at the wrong time. This left the two servers who remained to scramble like to hell to provide service to an unrealistic number of tables. We finally left our table and attempted to pay at the bar. The food wasn&#39;t bad. The presentation was nice and everything tasted palatable. The main problem was that it was bland. The french onion soup had a really odd sweetened flavor to it -- as though too much tomato paste had been stirred in. It tasted like a French-Italian onion soup. Not bad, but not really the rich savory broth one expects with this dish. The frites and beet salad were both good with sizable portions. The frites were very thin and crispy. Our other appetizer was the grilled cheese meatballs - tiny grilled cheese bites filled with soft meatballs. Again, the strong tomato/marinara flavor.  Overall, would probably stop here again for a drink at the bar (there are also two flat screen TVs, a good wine-by-the-glass selection, and a decent draft beer list), but skip out on a sit-down meal."

It looks like there is wi-fi but it had a password that wasn&#39;t guessable and I didn&#39;t feel like tracking someone down to ask. There is a &#34;dress code&#34; but it&#39;s pretty much - don&#39;t wear sweatpants and shirts with holes in it. I did see someone get turned away later in the night because he had a pretty grungy shirt on. But yes jeans and a nice top are fine for girls and guys. I was with a group of 8 other women and they were able to accommodate all of us just fine. I had the fiery pasta, which was very good. Had quite the kick to it! I was hoping to bring half of it home but I ended up eating all of it because it was so good. Other entrees my table had was burgers, pizza and salads and nothing had a bad review. My only complaint was a bad drink that I had sent back to get fixed and ended up sending it back again, I&#39;d stick to just the drinks that are listed on the menu to be safe next time. At the end of dinner they came out with a s&#39;mores pizza and a sparkler for her birthday. The s&#39;mores pizza was delicious!! I almost ordered one just to take home for later but I don&#39;t think it&#39;d warm up the same delicious way. I highly recommend that for dessert.  I would certainly come here again for drinks, dinner or dessert. Great location, service and atmosphere."

I can not be more grateful for the City Grill and their fantastic staff. I celebrated New Years Eve with the VIP package. Money well spent!  This night was not just a NYE celebration, it was also the night I knew my wonderful friend would be proposed to. How smoothly the night went! From the moment I walked in the doors, all staff were aware of the situation. They were accommodating of our special request and put us at our own table of four, whereas everyone else was at tables of 10+. The food was fantastic, the open bar was more than I ever expected, staff were attentive and composed - even through some delays with seating and meal times - and the night was the best it could possibly be.  We were checked on many times by many different staff and asked, &#34;is there anything we can do to make your night better?&#34;  Thank you City Grill staff for making our night so very, very special. We will absolutely be back.  Please note - they are much more than &#34;business casual!&#34; Don&#39;t undersell yourselves! Dress as nicely as you can!! Word around town is that they really don&#39;t like jeans, even if they&#39;re nice jeans! However, when I called to ask, I was only told, &#34;no ripped jeans, flip-flops, or hats.&#34; And boy was I underdressed!!  (The only downfall of the night was the shitty DJ; the night became something equivalent to the Jersey Shore)  Thank you City Grill!!!!!!!! Forever appreciative!!!"

The pizzas were also probably the best we&#39;ve had anywhere in Roch so far. We got the Greek, the mushroom and the meatball. The Greek was excellent - lots of flavor and toppings, and the crust held up well. The mushroom had truffle oil which I usually hate but it was very light, and with the cheese, made for a really delicious pizza. The meatball was ok - the red sauce was very generic and of the 3, this one seemed like it had sat a while before being served because the cheese was already congealed.

If I could give them zero stars, I would.  I booked my august 2015 wedding reception in May of this year. Karen, the &#34;event &amp; wedding coordinator&#34; put together a price list for all the food, drinks, etc. on an excel spreadsheet, and we paid a deposit of almost $2,000 to hold the date. Since the event was over a year away, we decided we would work out details of a contract/menu as we got a little closer, which is the norm for most venues.  Last month, I emailed Karen asking her if we could get some information in writing; ex: is our deposit refundable, what happens if the business closes, what are they liable/not liable for, etc. Her response was that the deposit was &#34;non-refundable&#34; even though neither of us signed or agreed to anything that said this. This is really where things went wrong. She took an email she wrote me in May, re-wrote it and  CHANGED IT and put in some blurb about the deposit being non-refundable. I immediately called her and asked her why she would do something like change an original email. She back peddled and said she &#34;sent me what was originally sent&#34; which was absolutely false, and that she would &#34;look into it the next day.&#34; She emailed me the next day to admit that there was nothing that said the deposit was non-refundable, and she would work on getting a contract to me. .  Over 5 weeks, I either emailed her or called her almost every day asking where the contract was. At this point, we were less than a year away from the date and I was anxious to see what other &#34;changes&#34; they planned on making. She gave me excuse after excuse why they weren&#39;t able to conjure up a contract. &#34;Legal needs to review it, the owners on vacation, all the partners need to look at it, etc.&#34; Finally I escalated to Lisa, and she promised me the contract would be sent to me within the next 2 business days. Surprise, surprise, over a week went by and I never heard from Karen.  I finally got in touch with her and told her the $2,000 we gave them obviously meant nothing to do them, and my needs as a customer were not a priority. I told her to forget the entire thing and just send me a check. A week went by and no check (we live within walking distance of the venue). I called Karen to see what the status was and she advised &#34;I don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t work in that department.&#34; I told her to give me the number so I could call myself, and she said she would look into it and call me back that day. Once again, she never followed up with me. I finally got Lisa on the phone and she told me she was &#34;seeing the check being written as we spoke&#34; AKA Karen never even told someone to refund my deposit money. This place has potential, but if they continue to let Karen run their event planning, they&#39;re screwed. She&#39;s unprofessional, she never follows up, and she is dishonest with her customers. I finally got my check and have booked my venue elsewhere!!!!"

We had a group of eight and we got a reservation for 8:30 on a Saturday night. This got pushed back by restaurant staff to 8:45 but then we didn&#39;t sit until 9:20. We were told we would get complimentary appetizers for the wait but they were on the bill anyway. While we waited to be seated we tried to socialize in the very crowded bar and were served by a not so cheery bartender. I was excited to try the wood fired pizza but was disappointed with the bland, soggy dough that had all the cheese piled toward the middle (a pet peeve for pizza lovers) and the sweet sauce that tasted like it came from a certain children&#39;s canned pasta. I will be honest and say that the Black Raspberry Iced Tea cocktail and the meatball sliders were the highlights of my experience but still nothing extraordinary. To end our night my husband and I waited for 45 minutes in an outdoor tent because the valet service ignored our ticket and then could not find our keys. The people in the other two cars that came with us were home before we got in our car to leave the restaurant. They need a system for dealing with the number of cars going in and out of that place. Also, I resent dress codes, especially since I&#39;m giving lots of my money to the establishment. I&#39;m still scratching my head about the popularity of this place and I can only come up with &#34;location&#34; since it is in an up and coming hot spot."

What happened to that place? My husband and I were looking for a nice dinner on a bitter cold night. We should have turned around as soon as we arrived! The hostess was dismissive and rude, and grudgingly took us to a table, where we watched servers rush back and forth past us for 35 minutes, until we finally grabbed someone to order a drink. The dining room was half empty. It gets worse. We wanted to leave, but our daughter was joining us after she finished work nearby, so we stayed. Our phones kept buzzing, and I&#39;m glad we finally answered because it was our daughter, freezing outside the door! The bouncer would not let her in to join us in the dining room because she was under-age and the kitchen would be closing soon. When I went to the door to get her I told the bouncer she was joining us for dinner and he actually tried to prevent her from coming through the door by stepping in between us. I got in his face (okay, his throat, since he&#39;s bigger than I am) to tell him &#34;I&#39;m her mother and she&#39;s coming with ME!&#34; and had to literally pull her past the jerk. Our meals were okay; she loved eating her sliders by the fire since the wait outside left her so cold.  The porch is great and there is so much potential, but the people at City Grill have a terrible attitude. Skip this place -- they do not appreciate, and therefore do not deserve, your business. Give your patronage to Black &amp; Blue, Tratta, 2 Vine, Max&#39;s Chop House, or Char, and you will be rewarded with a great vibe, a great experience, and great service."

The good; The ambiance is top notch, with a spectacular patio in the summer, outdoor fireplaces, and a very trendy interior. The decorator really nailed it with using the space to its potential. Drinks are strong and tasty and the food isnt bad. It wont be the best meal you have ever had, but its hardly horrible. The bad; the service. Whomever runs the front of the house should be removed. Employees are not trained to serve, but instead to speak to one another and count their money. I have had to wait time and time again for long periods of time while employees laughed with each other and counted money instead of serving the guests. And then theres your credit card. Twice, yes twice now, I have had credit card tips added to my bill. I save all of my receipts and always tip in cash so employees are not taxed on my tip. Twice tips were added to my bill, even after I wrote CASH on the tip line. I have gone back and the manager refunded the amount both times, but it is still very, very wrong. They are obviously teaching the employees it is ok to ignore the customers and blatantly steal from them. Be careful. Update 9/11/14: I went back for dinner recently and the manager recognized me from my YELP review. They apologized and said that the issue has been corrected. I was sure to pay in cash this time. I had the 1/2 wood fired chicken and it was delicious. I subbed the mac and cheese side for the vegetable of the day. My vegetable came out with probably a whole stick of butter melted over it, so I sent it back to ask for one clean. The vegetable of the day was delicious after that. My dining companion tried the chicken cutlets and wasnt as happy with them as I was with my 1/2 chicken. She was hardly repulsed, but ended up regretting not getting the 1/2 chicken. Her cutlets were a little soggy and she felt she wouldnt order them again. She also ordered a side of mac and cheese and really enjoyed it."

I walked into the former coyote joes impressed. There was a spectacular fireplace outside, and the remodeling of the outside patio was truly impressive. Entering I noticed the bar area which appeared expanded because of the open floor plan to the patio. Once again, impressive.  We were seated after a bit of confusion on the part of the hostess, which must have been contagious because the entire wait staff appeared incompetent. We sat down for a good 25 minutes before anyone brought us a water. Ten minutes later, we encountered the biggest coward of a waitress in the history of the dining industry.  It&#39;s not often necessary that you need to set aside an entire paragraph to describe how insignificant your waitress can make you feel, but in this case I have no choice. She didn&#39;t apologize for the half hour wait before her shoddy introduction (which had no mention of any specials, I had to ask for them). 25 minutes later I was starving. Then my soda water, wait my drink came. Signature mojitos should taste like rum, right? Ranting sorry. I hate to skip ahead to the end of the meal but she cleared the table without asking if we were done with any our supposed extra crispy fries, which of course where as soggy as the spaghetti noodles cooked in the pasta someone at my table ate. I feel forced to skip to the food because this is going way to long. Feel lucky for your tip, both girls in the party were waitresses. Anyways, I ordered grilled octopus which still had the quill cut into my first bite. For those of you who are not familiar, the quill of an octopus has the consistency of a plastic knife. Yummy. Sent that back and waited another 20 minutes for a tasteless piece of grouper, raw asparagus and an ok piece of skirt steak. At this point that waitress had disappeared for countless other minions of incompetence. I asked this one guy to bring some of the sauce from the steak for the fish, but he didn&#39;t come back with it until both meals were finished due to 1st world starvation. At least he apologized as he cleared my plate. This could go on and on but honestly I&#39;m bored at this point.  If you want to go to a trendy place, stop in. But don&#39;t expect the valet to find your keys, the place even messed that up. After the worst dining experience ever, my keys were lost for 20 minutes, in the rain. Exasperated, I took my key from the valet, walked to the furthest spot in the parking lot where my car was parked to never return again."

I had heard mixed to negative reviews about this place, but when a friend suggested meeting up here for a drink, I agreed. Neither of us had been before, and she wanted somewhere with a patio. We got there around 7:30pm, and it was pretty hopping for a Monday evening - in fact, the patio was so full that we ended up sitting inside at the bar. The hostess that greeted us was polite and friendly.  Our bartender seemed a little spacey, but I understand this place brand new, so I can give him a pass on seeming confused when we asked general questions. However, we were both annoyed that we had to ASK for a cocktail menu, and then it took a good 5-7 minutes before he asked us if we had decided. In a busy bar, totally acceptable, however there were a few bartenders working the bar that night, and I would say there were less than a dozen customers seated at the bar (most were outside). We both ordered margaritas - she a mango-flavored one, and I ordered the &#34;off the deep end&#34; - margarita with muddled raspberries. It was a beautiful color, and it was delicious. I would have liked to taste the tequila a bit more, but it was very tasty. We both ended up ordering the roasted beet salad (after flagging the bartender down again and asking to order). I had heard the food here was mediocre at best, but I think the kitchen has this salad figured out, as it was very, very good. Golden beets with radicchio and frisse lettuce with goat cheese and a shallot vinaigrette. It was very filling.  The patio is beautiful, and I&#39;d be willing to try this place out again. I&#39;m hoping our bartender was still learning, because the inattentive service is what kept me from giving a higher rating."

I can get top shelf liquors at a significantly better price at just about any of the other bars in this neighborhood.  If I&#39;m dining in, I can get better food for a much better price, just one block over at any of the numerous restaurants on University Avenue. I may be the wrong person to be reviewing City Grill and therefore my review may not help you, but I&#39;d like to think I&#39;m kinda hip and at the very least, I very much enjoy a night out with my friends having some well made mixed drinks in an environment I&#39;m not constantly being judged in.  Unfortunately, 15-20 minutes of attempts at borderline elbowing my way up to the bar tenders peripheral field of view doesn&#39;t make me feel all that warm and fuzzy. I&#39;ve been here on three different days and have yet to find a time when I believe the service has improved.  It&#39;s only been about two months since they&#39;ve opened so I imagine they&#39;re just getting in the groove now, so I&#39;ll try back again, because at the end of the day, the building is just so beautiful you can&#39;t help but want to be there."

The menu itself is solid, nothing amazing, but very solid.  It primarily focuses on &#34;wood-fired,&#34; which I&#39;m personally a fan of.  It doesn&#39;t really bring much to the table that other places in Rochester don&#39;t already do, but there&#39;s nothing inherently wrong with that.  The prices are very reasonable for a &#34;fancy&#34; restaurant.  The cocktails looked interesting, some cool takes on martinis and mojitos (and I&#39;m sure they can make any other cocktail hour classic).  The wine list was heavy on mid-range wine, I was very happy to see a good amount of Finger Lakes wines on the list, always nice to stay local.  The service top-to-bottom was excellent, nothing to possibly complain about, I was extremely impressed considering it was opening night. For an appetizer I got the wood-fired French Onion Soup.  This was really a show stealer at $5.  The broth itself had great flavor, a hint of smokiness that comes from the wood oven, and an awesome amount of salt (without being overpowering and turning into a salt lick).  There was a nicely toasted piece of baguette in the soup that held up quite well without getting overly soggy.  And of course, it was topped with a gratuitous amount of cheese (mozzarella I do believe, which fit quite well with the whole undertone of smoke in the dish).  I was very pleased and would certainly order this again.  For an entree, I got the 1/2 of a Wood-Fired Chicken and got Truffle Fries instead of Mac and Cheese.  The fries were great, very reminiscent of the fries at JoJo out in Pittsford (which is a very good thing).  Nice and thin cut, well fried, not too soggy, and not overbearingly truffle flavored.  They came with some homemade ketchup which was a great touch, had a touch of tabasco sauce that brought the tomato flavors out, a great addition.  The chicken itself was well-cooked with a wonderfully crispy skin, but kind of lacked any &#34;oomph.&#34;  It needs a bit more something, I was hoping for a great wood-smoked flavor, but really didn&#39;t get any of that.  The sauce that came with it was tasty, but there was hardly enough for the amount of chicken brought out.  It was good, just not great.  The pizzas that were coming out did look really good though (though I didn&#39;t get a chance to taste them). I&#39;d really call this a 4.4 star review, really close to me just edging over to five stars, but not quite all the way there (though this is an opening night review so you can&#39;t blame them for not being perfect on the first night!)"

It was presented very well, and then fork in mouth and the most bland tartare I have ever consumed. It has white rice on the bottom with had no flavor either, the tuna was thick chunks and inconsistent knife cuts. I had to ask the bartender for salt and pepper to try to save the mush that I was just served. That didn&#39;t even work, after 3 bites I gave up. The bartender never asked how it was just cleared my plate when she knew I was finished. I wish she would have asked because I really just wanted her to know so she could make the kitchen staff aware of how bland and uneatable that dish is.

I won&#39;t go into much detail because I think they need a SIGNIFICANT amount of work in the kitchen before things turn around here.  The pizza was good, but not particularly flavorful.  I think JoJo&#39;s does a better job.  So does Boccacini&#39;s.  Truffle chips - no.  Just avoid them.  Tator tots, we didn&#39;t try them but our friends advised us against them.  Roasted beet salad - completely uninspiring.  Where were the beets?  One friend did have the NY Strip.  It looked quite good.  Desserts were okay, but nothing special.  The ice cream in the oversized martini glass is showy and enough for two.  I&#39;d say get it at the bar with a few drinks and indulge yourself.  Just avoid the restaurant."

Well you know the story, we arrived there and the restaurant was closed. I sent an e-mail of complaint to City Grill and have not heard back from them. It&#39;s one thing to make a mistake on the hours of operation (although most hostesses worth their salt would know the hours) but to compound it by receiving a note from a dissatisfied customer and just ignore it is unbelievable to me.

We had dinner both Friday and Saturday night at City Grill, each night with a party of 8 or more. As far as appetizers, each night they were fabulous. We ordered the grilled calamari, that had nicely roasted mini peppers too. The Eggplant stack appetizer was a huge hit too. The eggplant was cut the long way and lightly fried and layered at least 5 layers and finished with fresh shaved parm and a balsamic glaze drizzle. Yum. We order the margarita pizza also for a appetizer and it was a crispy crust and very flavorful and fresh tasting. I highly recommend these appetizers.<br>  Moving onto Salads... The grilled Caesar salad. Very impressed. The flavor was spot on. The dressing drizzled, the lettuce cooked just perfect. Friday night I had the Beet Salad it had 2 different colored beets, goat cheese and frisee greens and a tasty vinaigrette. Some one at the table had the house salad and chopped salad and all good salads.<br>   Moving onto Dinner..  I can&#39;t say enough on how tasty our entrees were. First of all, if you love chicken cutlets, you NEED to have it here. 2 chicken cutlets, pan seared perfectly served on a small amount of arugula and the most outstanding lemon sauce drizzled on top. I had this both nights I loved it so much! My husband had the burger and let me tell you its amazing! Its one of those juicy lucy type burgers on a very tasty bun and it has the restaurants name seared into the bun.. The fries.. OMG they r truffle french fries!!! Someone at the table had skirt steak, and I took a bite and thought the flavor was great. <br>   Moving onto Dessert, as if we didn&#39;t eat enough... I don&#39;t know what it was called but it was a grilled dessert pizza that tasted like nutella on it. We ate it in 1.5 seconds and loved every minute of it.<br>    The bar is fun, lively, and has vitality. It appears that the crowd is a mixture of professional 30/40 year olds. <br> Both nights, later in evening they had a DJ that played good music. I feel like  I&#39;m in Florida at City Grill. I really like the vibe.  <br>  The decor is impressive. They did a beautiful job all around. I love how the doors at the front of bar open up to east ave. I look forward to lunch out there this summer."

It is nice to have the option to eat sushi with that one friend who refuses to eat raw fish no matter how hard you try to convert them. However, the sushi here is a mixed bag. The fish in my sushi lunch was thick - a more generous serving than other sushi places around town. However, it didn&#39;t taste particularly fresh. The special rolls I tried were passable. Their salad however was one of the best sushi-lunch-accompaniment salads I have tried in Rochester. The dressing was full of grated ginger - delicious! My biggest issue with House of Sushi is their pricing. Their prices don&#39;t seem to match their quality but it certainly matches the East Ave location. I am unlikely to venture here by myself but would be okay accompanying someone who wants to go."

I wasn&#39;t even sure that is for sushi or they just give me a very generic soy sauce for all things served in the restaurant.  For that meal we order 4 different rolls (Spider, Spicy Tuna, Futomaki, and a specialty eel rolls) The rolls are definitely the highlight of the meal. Even through the sauce is slightly overpowering the ingredients. The rolls are still quite delicious. But then when our order of Nigiri sushi came up, it really dampered me expectation for this restaurant. The nori wraps were soggy and cannot really hold our Uni Gunkanmaki. The salmon, yellowtail and red snapper were pre-cut and frankly a little dry. The fish just fell off the rice because they are not &#34;held&#34; or &#34;pressed&#34; by a sushi chef.

The Golden Port Dim Sum Restaurant and House of Sushi are essentially housed under the same roof.  Whether seated at 101 or 105 East Avenue, diners are free order from one or both of the menus.  It&#39;s easier to feel the mingling of the two on the Golden Port side.  On the House of Sushi side, I feel somewhat aloof from the Golden Port side and the staff is more likely to assume that our dining party is only interested in the House of Sushi offerings.   I eat here when dinner must fit location, overall dining party preference and/or time constraints. House of Sushi&#39;s sushi and sashimi offerings are surprisingly diverse and numerous (not on an absolute scale - I just didn&#39;t expect it from this place), and of decent quality.  Having uni and quail eggs on the menu is a nice touch.  While the quality of the uni is typically just OK, it&#39;s never been a huge disappointment.  House of Sushi gets points for offering &#39;fun rolls&#39; while not favoring them to the exclusion of the more simple and traditional rolls.  I&#39;ve been surprised by how sloppily wrapped some of the rolls have been (shouldn&#39;t have been surprised - it doesn&#39;t seem out of character for them), but somehow it&#39;s more amusing than irritating.  I&#39;ve found the offerings outside the sushi and sashimi to be disappointing.  Eating from the House of Sushi menu will rack up a larger bill than eating from the Golden Port menu, but the prices compare well with other sushi places (and, for me at least, the Golden Port offerings are generally unappetizing).  The wait-staff is attentive but can be a little flaky.  They don&#39;t seem knowledgeable about the food, and on more than one occasion when we asked for the sake menu/list we were told that it didn&#39;t exist (it does, but only occasionally do we press them to produce it).  The degree to which we wonder about the staff is reflected in our original fear that they would warm the cold sake we had ordered (they didn&#39;t).  I advise those with a discerning palate to stick with the sushi and sashimi offerings and to resist the impulse to order from the rest of the menu or the Golden Port menu."

The food here was overpriced slop. Ok, the bread was nice and the mac and cheese appetizer was acceptable but the entrees were lousy. If you make the poor decision to come here don&#39;t order the boneless chicken entree like I did...the asiago crust was just weird and the dish had too much liquid pooling on the bottom of the plate.

The garlic basil aioli was sooooo flavorful.  Baked chicken wings, the parmesan cheese gave a nice salty contrast to the delicious black pepper dipping sauce.  Calamari was super tender, the accompanying sauce was mildly flavored. White pizza, great homemade dough was golden and crisp on the outside. Deep dish style was mostly dough but the flavorful ingredients held their own, especially the garlic.  Steak special, cooked rare to order but it was chewy and tough.  Could be my fault for ordering that cut rare. Fantastic bacon, fontina risotto cake hid underneath. The cheese crisped up and caramelized on the bottom while the center remained creamy. The delicate green beans were tender with a slight crisp. The steak was served with a pesto but being allergic to walnuts I asked for the blueberry eggplant caponata that accompanied the fish special FANTASTIC! The eggplant was dense enough to maintain a meaty texture, the blueberries provided a nice subtle summer note and aftertaste.

So for our 35th Anniversary we took the opportunity to go to the &#34;Grille at One&#34; for our dinner.  We are so glad we did, the whole night was wonderful!  Our reservations were for 6:45 on a Wednesday night.  When we entered the restaurant we were presently surprised by the warm cozy feeling of the restaurant and bar. We arrived a bit early so decided to go the bar for a cocktail before being seated.  They were in the middle of a wine tasting that they do on the third Wed of the month.   The bartender and hostess explained the tasting process which includes small plates served with wine pairings.  We will definitely be coming back to do that. They even offered us a slice of the deep dish pizza to go with our drinks that was being served to the wine tasting party at that time. Once we were seated our waitress came by and introduced herself and acknowledged that we were celebrating a special night and really made us feel very special.  It seemed like everyone that waited on us from Hostess, Bartender, to Waitress all treated us as special guests.  By the end of the night it was evident that they treat everyone as special guests.  Wow, what a change from many of the restaurants you attend, where you are treated like a number or an interruption to their evening.  We looked over the wine selection and was surprised by the affordable prices and good selection. We quickly found a good selection to go along with our meals.  We had already taken the opportunity while at the bar to start looking over the menu.  The menu is straight forward and not complicated by offering you too many selections.  It is still diverse though and offers, appetizers (small plates ), salads, upscale burgers and entrees ( large plates ).   We ordered the Fried Calamari as an app while we decided on dinner. The calamari came out very lightly battered, almost tempura like.  It was soo tender and light.  I would have preferred a sauce with a bit more heat but the sauce that came with it had a light orange flavor and paired well with them. The best we both have had in years. For dinner my wife ordered the salmon, which was served over a portion of crispy polenta.  The fish was done perfectly and the polenta was a great pairing.  I ordered the veal short ribs.  They came with a side dish of Truffle mac and cheese and a red wine sauce over the ribs.  I would have liked the ribs just a little rarer but that is just my liking, I am sure that they were cooked perfectly for most diners.  The sauce was velvety and the mac and cheese, I want the recipe!  Mac and Cheese will never be the same after eating theirs.  I&#39;m a very accomplished cook and can sometimes be very critical of dinners I get outside of my kitchen but that dish of mac and cheese was the most delicious I have ever eaten.   For me, the topping for the night was the Chef coming out to our table and inquiring about the meal and thanking us for giving him the opportunity to cook for us.  What a treat!  I will say my wife&#39;s special moment was the complimentary Chocolate &amp; Cherry Roulade dessert that came to the table with &#34;Happy Anniversary&#34; written in chocolate on the plate.   This is one of Rochester&#39;s best kept secrets.  I know once the word gets out this will be the Go-to-Place in Rochester. Until then it will stay our little secret!"

I had made a reservation earlier in the week, however they didn&#39;t have record of it. This did not stop them from finding a place to seat us promptly. Service was fairly slow although they were moderately busy. There was a prix fixe menu that was made up of various options from the regular menu as well as the regular menu available to order from. I started with a beet salad, which was described as containing charred beets. I did not see or taste any char, but the salad was delicious none the less with lots of beets, goat cheese and candied walnuts. My entree was a burger which was cooked exactly to medium as I requested. It was very flavorful and came on a nice roll that was not too big as compared to the burger and toppings. It was served with a large portion of seasoned fries. The fries were kind of limp and unless there was a good dose of seasoning on it, pretty bland. For $11, I thought it was a great value given the quality of the meat and size of the sandwich. When compared to what you pay at chain restaurants for the same type of meal, this was definitely a cut above. The menu has a good range of options to choose from. The atmosphere was upscale although a bit dated feeling in decor. Not quite as contemporary as I was expecting after hearing about the &#34;NYC vibe&#34; of the place. There was a large bar with a decent wine and beer menu. There was also a cocktail menu. Overall, it was a good meal, but the experience was very average.

There is a surprising amount of room in this coffee shop with two open rooms on either side of the cafe. Most are two-seat tables perfect for an afternoon work session or a meeting (plus lots of outlets to charge your laptop). In the room to the right of the coffee bar, there&#39;s a baby grand piano for anyone to play. I&#39;ve been there a few times and some Eastman students have practiced on it. Actually quite relaxing background music. Another reason I enjoy spending an afternoon here, the big windows that line the main walls. It&#39;s bright, great for people watching and makes it feel like you&#39;re outside even when you can&#39;t be. That will be ideal for me in the winter when I have home-office cabin fever and need an escape. I stick with the americano here. It&#39;s actually the only coffee drink I&#39;ve ordered at all my visits. It&#39;s bold and energizing. Their fresh squeezed lemonade was great on a hot summer day -- perfectly balanced between sweet and tart.  For lunch I&#39;ve had the turkey panini and the caprese panini. Both are like fancy grilled cheeses -- super melty, creamy mozz cheese sandwich the filling. They use bread from 2Vine. It comes with either chips or fruit as a side. Looking forward to trying their baked goods next visit -- like their blueberry scone -- since the whole place smelled like fresh baked goodies. It was like grandma&#39;s kitchen.

There were several tables occupied with some people studying/working and a group of a few men sipping their coffees and chatting on this gorgeous spring day. The door was open, which helped with the airy and light feel. I&#39;ll definitely try this place out again, as it&#39;s in a super convenient spot; hopefully a better experience next time!"

Quiet, with a good amount of seating inside and outside. Latte was on the strong side (much appreciated!) Could not resist getting a beignet as well. Incredibly satisfying and just the right amount of sweet. Latte and beignet cost me $4.50, not bad. Free wifi is a plus! The baked goods available change each time I visit. Update:<br>Other things I&#39;ve since tried here... This list will likely continue to expand: Balsamic, tomato, cheese quiche - good, but a bit difficult to eat as it comes in a small pie tin and has a thick crust. Fork or hand? I still can&#39;t decide.<br>Hot chocolate - definitely too sweet for me. <br>Apple cider - good, but essentially just heated up apple cider. Where&#39;s the cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg? Maybe I&#39;m just too picky...<br>Apple cider doughnut - not enough apple flavor to warrant the apple cider label.<br>Apple pie - delicious! Very flaky crust. I wish it came warm though."

I wish they had more in the way of food, especially since they were out of 2/3 of their kinds of panini, and the caprese panini was what I was really looking forward to. Really nice people though-they gave me a large coffee for medium price since they were out of medium cups, when they could have just made a medium in a large cup.

I went around 6:30 at night and there were a bunch of guys just relaxing and smoking. I walked in and one of the guys walked right up to me and asked how he could help. I described the kind of smoker my boyfriend is, and the type of cigar he prefers. I&#39;m pretty clueless about cigars as a whole, but the gentleman that helped me was very knowledgeable and took his time explaining which cigars would be best for my boyfriend.   I left with two really great, very fairly priced cigars, that I&#39;m sure my boyfriend will love. I&#39;ll be sure to keep Santiago&#39;s in mind for Christmas, Valentine&#39;s, and Birthdays from now on. I also highly suggest leaving a tip. Of course it&#39;s not required but the tips go to the rollers, which is great because rolling all those gorgeous looking cigars and not smoking them all must be pretty hard on them! Plus...expertly hand rolled cigars? How awesome is that?? Overall, I really enjoyed my experience. I felt very welcomed and everyone was very helpful. I wish I had asked the name of the gentleman who helped me...he was really great. Thanks again!"

It is worth a visit for anyone that enjoys fine cigars."

The Dominican owners hand roll their cigars, they make them in house and sometimes you can watch them do it. There&#39;s an excellent selection in their walk-in humidor, and they&#39;re very fairly priced. I&#39;d say they&#39;re actually on the lower end of how much you&#39;d pay for a cigar. But the quality is excellent. You can buy single cigars, boxes, packages.  In addition to their traditional cigars, they also have a selection of flavored cigars - vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, etc. I&#39;m not one for flavored cigars (I&#39;m a Maduro Robusto kind of person), BUT, they do make a great Makers Mark flavored one that I like on occasion.  If you need help choosing, the staff and owners are always happy to help. They have a selection of humidors and cutters up front at the desk as well. If you don&#39;t have a cutter, and want to smoke ASAP, just say yes when they ask if you want them to cut your cigar for you.  Santiago has a patio where you can smoke, you can also smoke inside in their lounge (I think). During the nicer months there are always a couple characters out on the porch."

The store itself is very handsome.  This is the place for local cheese, produce and meat. They even had the beer I had been searching out.  Yes it&#39;s pricey. Being a small business in the middle of downtown I get it. I had to giggle at the eggs that were from a producer in my little home town in the Finger Lakes for six bucks a dozen.  I could not pass up the multicolored organic carrots. They were stunning as was all the produce. Gorgeous spinach and they even sliced open varieties of oranges to display the fruit.

It&#39;s my go-to grocer in terms of products carried and customer service. And the fact that they&#39;re in the city proper means they serve a population who hasn&#39;t had options like this in awhile, from downtown workers to residents of city neighborhoods. Grocery: They carry a wide variety vegan staples like milk cheese, meat, condiments like sour cream and creamcheese; a bunch of frozen or boxed ready to eat meals; and a ton of vegan desserts. They&#39;re the only place to find the Daiya gouda flavor, and the only people to carry DFMavens vegan icecream (try it, you won&#39;t regret it!). It&#39;s like walking into a paradise full of safe food every time I come here. Also, the produce is of good variety, always fresh, and a lot of items are sourced locally, which is a huge plus (love the local apple cider they sell). They serve Boar&#39;s Head brand deli meats, which are way better than the Wegmans store brand options. And their meat counter looks to be well-stocked as well.  Service: Top-notch. Their cashiers are always friendly and funny. Their Purchasing department is extremely responsive to product requests - I said &#34;it would be cool to see Daiya mac and cheese&#34; to their manager and it was on the shelves a week later! Prepared Foods: Their tea and coffee is great! I love that they carry desserts for omnivores and they also carry vegan options. I haven&#39;t had any of their hot foods yet but I like that they have vegan options as well as the usual meat fare for omnivores. Basically, Hart&#39;s is perfect!"

(A brief moment of silence for the Midtown Wegmans, if you will.) Since I missed out on this vital piece of history, taking advantage of Hart&#39;s is not only convenient for me, but pays tribute to our ancestors. Before Hart&#39;s opened up in the East End, the name had almost completely faded away, lingering in places like the Hart Theatre at the JCC. Needless to say, Hart&#39;s is a welcome addition to the neighborhood and a sorely needed staple. I had the chance to become intimately familiar with Hart&#39;s over the summer, when it was the pickup location for my CSA box. Before that, I&#39;d been in a few times, but only to grab one or two things. It&#39;s still super convenient to stop here after work if you need that one last ingredient for something, or if you just want an extra item for your pantry. I have done this many times, and it&#39;s much easier to do when you&#39;re not lugging around a box of produce in one hand. Consider the prepared foods section the next time you&#39;re not sure of what to do for dinner, or even if you just want to pick up lunch one day. Many of the good lunch places downtown are closed on the weekends, but Hart&#39;s isn&#39;t, and for that I&#39;m eternally grateful. Everyone knows how hard it is to get a sandwich downtown after 2:00 p.m., after all. Next time your meeting gets out late and you&#39;re desperate for lunch, zip over to Hart&#39;s post haste for something that&#39;s actually open. Hart&#39;s is known around town for focusing on local products, including (but not limited to) F. Oliver&#39;s, Stuart&#39;s Spices, Pittsford Dairy, and Eat Me Ice Cream, among others. It&#39;s beyond convenient to have all these products under one roof. At one time, there was a dedicated shelf for local products, but now the products are mixed in with their respective peers. Having these items available is a huge help for people who want to buy local but might not know where to start. Plus, every time I&#39;ve been in, there have been numerous tastings waiting for me. It&#39;s a nice gesture to have the producers of the local goods available to tell me why I should focus on their product, and then let me be the judge myself. Also, sign up for the free rewards card to earn points on all those local purchases. Who doesn&#39;t like earning points on shopping? Beware, as many people have mentioned, about the price gouging. Yes, prices here are higher than Tops and Wegmans, and if you truly want to do a full grocery run, you&#39;ll need to budget in for the price increases. Not a huge deal when picking up one or two things, but definitely something to consider. On the whole, I&#39;m really happy that Hart&#39;s decided to move in, and I&#39;ll continue to support them as best I can. It&#39;s a risk to open a grocery store downtown, but the environment is changing and people want different things than they did 20 years ago. Hart&#39;s is doing a good job in paying tribute to the past and advocating for the future."

I like that they have a lot of local products. Another thing I really think sets them apart are their vendor events. Once a month or so, they have a lot of vendors come in and provide samples of their products. This is great because 1) fun event with free food and 2) you get to try before you buy. A lot of their products run a bit on the pricier side and some are worth it, but you would want to know before you buy, right?  Departments that I really think are worth checking out: the cheese case, the dairy case, and the ice cream case, and the local products showcase in the front of the store. All these areas have some cool products that really aren&#39;t easily found elsewhere.  Skip: bread. If you want just plain, fresh baguettes, loaves, etc. just go to Wegmans. Also while their grill area has some really promising looking menu items, I can&#39;t order from there again because one time I got a breakfast sandwich that SO greasy.  Overall, I have to echo the sentiment that many others have already shared that I would not shop here regularly, but it is an inviting store and I will continue to stop in once in a while for the different variety of items."

A lot. It&#39;s great that it is easy to get to, and that they deliver (not going to lie, since I have no car and live in the South Wedge, delivery might be the best thing since sliced bread come winter). They&#39;ve sponsored all kinds of cool things I&#39;ve been to in Rochester (see: the Tweed Ride), and generally seem to be out there doing cool and fun things (see: killing it at the genesee center for the arts chilli cook-off last year).  There are many things I appreciate about them, especially their convenience and the variety in organic or local products. The beer selection is often well curated (though, admittedly a little IPA heavy the last time I was in :P), and the meat section is one of my favs in town (I got a lot of compliments this summer for the sausages I brought to cook-outs).  If I have one complaint, however, it&#39;s that a few staples are a bit pricey / unnecessary. I was in a bit of a bind for some white sugar one day, and the prices were too steep. I made a second stop at Abundance on my way home and saved some $$$ by buying sugar from the bulk section.  Pro-tip: if you&#39;re a student they give a 10% discount on Mondays.<br>Pro-tip #2: become a member. if you lose your card (like I did, promptly) they can look it up at the cash - who doesn&#39;t like points that get you swag?)."

VonBrake Spices: Jennifer Brake did an awesome presentation on different home grown spices made organically.  There is a lot of work involved producing products organically, especially something as simple as spices.  Jennifer made it look effortless, and the end product tasted great. Mountain Rise Granola: Vegan Granola bars ROCK!! I had the chocolate one, and the Original Vegan.  All made with fresh organic grains.  Both were not dry, but flavorful and crunchy. Allens Hill Farm: FAMOUS for there Apple Cider Molasses.  I could of eaten a WHOLE JAR of that.  It&#39;s all natural with no added sugars or syrups.  Again, random flavorful items you will find shopping at Hart&#39;s. The Piggery: which is Ithaca&#39;s ONLY farm to table butcher shop/ and wholesaler.  There salami tastes amazing, and fresh.  All made from local farmers.  I could see how getting something like this would be special because Brad Marshall travels long distance to reach the market here in Rochester. Coffee Connection:  Clearly locally brewed and made in the SouthWedge neighborhood.  I needed a cup of there freshly brewed Guatemalan coffee by the end of this event.  I learned from Marcella Richer the rising cost of coffee beans, and how local markets loose out to national chains because of it.  Hart&#39;s does a great job of supporting the local coffee brewers in the area. Eat Me Ice-Cream:  I love when they roll up the Eat Me Ice Cream Cart into the store.  Catelyn Augustine highlighted the famous Goat Cheese Ice-Cream at her cart today.  It was so rich and creamy, I could never taste any goat in it.  Plus with her platinum gold pants, Catelyn took ice-cream to a whole other Eat Me experience. Forge Hot Sauce:  The dynamic duo of Scott Stahl and Mike Fratangelo really elevated hot sauce to a whole new level.  The Verde sauce has a subtle heat from the  jalapeño and Poblano peppers.  Tasted like liquified grilled peppers, and onions into a convenient bottle.  This team surly turned up the HEAT at this event. Overall: Produced by the Upstate Farm Fresh Community, Specialty Products, Community Support, Organic, Vegan Granola Bars, Apple Cider Molasses, Salami, Hot Sauce, and Eat Me Ice-Cream...I will be back."

I hardly go in their without having an employee strike up a conversation with me. I know Rochester has Wegmans - but Hart&#39;s is worth checking out. You may not do all your shopping there - but they have enough specials and local items that make a weekly visit worth it!"

Needing a bite for dinner, and not realizing that Spot actually serves food (mediocre, but that&#39;s for another time and place), I decided to run into Hart&#39;s and grab a prepared meal for dinner. Overall, the prepared food didn&#39;t look appetizing and - *gasp* - it was more expensive than Wegman&#39;s, which pretty much sets my price benchmark for prepared supermarket food. I ended up ordering a sandwich from the store and took it go. Needless to say, when I unwrapped the sandwich, it was a globby, greasy mess that contained no vegetables, no meat (which I had been expecting, per the menu) - just 6 or 7 slices of melted cheese between two overly-buttered pieces of bread. Needless to say, I ended up throwing out the sandwich (which, if I recall, I spent $8-$9 on). Money down the drain. :/ This is not a review of Hart&#39;s as a grocery store - the store is clearly beneficial for people who live in the surrounding area.  One thing I did notice about the store though was how much open space there was. Normally, I would complain if a store was overly crowded, but I was surprised to see how much floor space is not being used and also by some of the food displays in the store (i.e., how inefficiently counter space was used for one food display I saw). On the basis of the food I got, I would rate Hart&#39;s a 1* for sure, but I also wouldn&#39;t want this rating to negatively influence the store&#39;s rating as most people are probably not coming here solely or primarily for prepared foods."

The location is convenient for people who work/live downtown. The spacious parking lot (located between 2 Vine and Hart&#39;s) makes it even easier to run in for a quick pick up. One of the entrances to the parking lot is right off the Inner Loop &#34;East Ave&#34; ramp. This store is well planned in terms of their target audience. Locally produced/grown, organic, and &#34;ethnic&#34; (Indian, Thai, Korean, Chinese, Mexican, etc) products make up most of the selection. I appreciate that the organic and traditional versions of products are in the same area. It makes it easier to compare prices/brands.  Their prepared food is still evolving. The things I have tried (chicken cacciatore, fried chicken, mac and cheese) were all very delicious. However, they are still trying to nail down what sells so don&#39;t get too attached to a particular dish as it may not be featured again anytime soon (I miss you, chicken cacciatore). I also like that most (if not all) the meat is cut in store. All the meat come from local farms. Their cheese area is a quick way to spend too much money. You can sample most of the cheese that is sold by weight - just ask an employee.  Speaking of employees, all of Hart&#39;s employees I have encountered are friendly, happy and helpful. Their prices do run about 10-20% higher than Wegmans. I am happy to pay this difference as I live in the area and abhor the East Ave Wegmans parking lot. Can you really put a price on not having your car dented by an idiot driver who doesn&#39;t know how to check their mirrors? (I can. My deductible is $500). For my weekly shopping, I will still go to Wegmans/Trader Joe&#39;s. For the daily things I like to forget, &#34;I don&#39;t feel like cooking dinner and want to pick up something&#34; nights or &#34;I really want some Lapsang Souchong cheese*&#34; cravings, Hart&#39;s is my choice.  *Lapsang Souchong cheese is a real thing. It is so good. You must try it."

As for the food products themselves, I&#39;d say Hart&#39;s is almost a bit of a specialty food store more than anything else.  They have a little bit of your standard fare you can find anywhere, but it&#39;s at least $1 more expensive than all of their nearby competitors.  I honestly don&#39;t think there&#39;s any chance I would buy any normal food item here when I can get the same thing significantly cheaper elsewhere. Where they really shine though, are in their locally sourced products.  All across the store dotted here and there are foods that you can only find from vendors at local farmer&#39;s markets or homemade mom-and-pop stores across upstate NY.  Seemingly the only place you could buy some of these products (like cheeses, cookies, flours, breads, soaps, chocolates, sauces, and more) would be directly from the individual vendors, so it&#39;s nice that there&#39;s finally a second option open 7 days a week to get them if you&#39;re on the lookout for them!  On top of that, they also have a wide variety of organic and gluten-friendly products all over as well.  Considering their location, this was an ingenious decision on their part.  Something that&#39;s not really for me, but something that the nearby students and hipsters will inevitably love. In any case, I have to say Hart&#39;s has a thumbs up from me.  I like their concept a lot, but they&#39;ve unfortunately not sold me enough as an average shopper in America.  If I want the locally sourced items then I&#39;ll just be patient get them directly from the vendors at the farmer&#39;s market.  It&#39;s just not worth it to me to pay the additional markup here, but best of luck to them!!"

Most meats are cured or flavored with some sort of sugar and sulfites in it&#39;s cure.  So most bacon &amp; breakfast sausage unless you buy it on line from across the country or make it yourself, you are out of luck.  Hart&#39;s is not different in this, but where they do differentiate themselves from wegmans is that they will make you bacon without the sugar and sulfites and man is it good!  They know exactly what goes into every type of sausage and every slice of bacon because they do it on site. If you talk to the meat manager, he will bend over backwards to accommodate your dietary restrictions in any way he can. I have never had such great customer service in my life.    They are a bit more expensive than wegmans on their meat.  Some of it is due to their size and volume and some of it is due to them using local small volume meat providers. You get what you pay for really rings true here.  Hopefully they can keep the costs down because that really is the only deterrent from buying all of my meat there. I&#39;ve heard great things about their prepared foods but have not tried them yet.  We have found some specialty items there and have bought cheese there as well.  Of course this was pre-whole 30, No dairy either. I just wish they had another store down in Greece a little closer to me.  Thank You Hart&#39;s for being another option for individuals looking for specialized customer service."

There&#39;s a lot on the shelves here that I&#39;ve never seen elsewhere or it&#39;s at some random place that I never think to visit. Convenience is key here. Being able to pick up toilet paper, veggies for dinner, and a cup of coffee before my next meeting is what makes Hart&#39;s amazing. I love the vibe -- modern, yet simple. I just think it&#39;s so nice to have a small manageable space to shop downtown. They&#39;re bringing us back to the 50s in some way. There are a few instances where I&#39;ve seen some price markups, but not everything. Also, a few times they ran out of items I was in need of for a dish (i.e. sour cream). So I still had to make another stop on my way home, which I try to avoid. I do think that mostly is attributed to beginning growing pains and they&#39;re getting the kinks worked out.

I am especially excited to see 1000 Islands River Rat Cheese on the shelves.<br>- Prepared food items for a quick dinner or an easy item to bring to a dinner party. Three bean salad is delicious.<br>- Cafe -- love their strong flavored coffee, hanging in the seating area for meetings, and their sandwich offerings are awesome. My favorite so far has been the grilled cheese with peaches.<br>- Donkey tortilla chips -- my new favorite tortilla chips. Just thick enough and perfectly salted. Great for dips, salsas, guac, etc.<br>- Fiz soda!!!! It&#39;s back on shelves. First place I&#39;ve seen it in years.<br>- Local products -- it&#39;s really awesome to see Hart&#39;s focus on local w/ almost 20% of their store sourced from the NY region. Can&#39;t wait to see this place thrive! I heart you, Hart&#39;s!"

I was able to find 1911 Blueberry Cider here after searching for it at places for months. Lots of fresh and healthy choices available.

I will say the man working in the diary section was very helpful in deciding on a specific cheese I needed for a  recipe. What bothered me the most, was when I purchased a raw-rotisserie chicken. I took a picture to show the manager. I was not looking for anything out of this, just wanted to let them know they were selling raw rotisserie chicken...She did not seem thankful that i let her know.

I couldn&#39;t make it to the yelp event for here but wanted to make sure that I went to the store so I could see what everything is all about.  Adam and I went on Saturday evening and we weren&#39;t really that impressed. I love the concept and I think it is really cool. I love supporting local businesses and products so it helps give some extra points to the store but overall, this isn&#39;t a place for me.  While looking around the manager came up to Adam and I and asked what we thought and told us that if there was anything that we wanted to see at the store to let them know so this way the store would have everything that we would want to complete our weekly grocery shopping. I like that she did that but, Adam and I probably won&#39;t go back.  I felt like everything was just too expensive to be buying from there all the time. I also felt like I need more variety than they offer. The place could be compared to Trader Joe&#39;s but I like TJ&#39;s a lot better. With TJ&#39;s, Adam and I can run in and great some great snacks or quick meals. We didn&#39;t get that feeling from Hart&#39;s. It could be that the place is just starting out and they need to figure out what the people really want and the correct price points but I just really wasn&#39;t that impressed to want to go back. A couple of other downsides, they need more shopping baskets. The store was pretty quiet when we got there so there should have been more baskets but there weren&#39;t any left for us. Also, the parking lot is kind of small. We got lucky and found a spot as someone else was pulling away. Overall, it is a great concept but I was just not a fan of what the store had to offer and probably won&#39;t be back."

I&#39;d say another one but the Wegman&#39;s on East Ave is just about the greatest travesty ever built. Any ways, I Hart&#39;s isn&#39;t new but I kept forgetting to check it out till this past weekend. After hitting up the Public Market my fiance reminded me we had another stop but neither of us could remember where. She knew it started with an H and after a long and ridiculous discussion we figured out it was Hart&#39;s!! So away we went. A pretty big parking lot makes getting in and out easy. This store definitely caters to a higher end crowd. Most of the options are vegan, gluten free, vegetarian, organic or some combination there within. Most prices are about twice what you would find at other stores, even flower is twice as expensive. What is important to remember though is that it is a smaller and more convenient stop. They also have a lot of options you can&#39;t find at other stores. For me the major pluses were a huge beer selection, a huge meat selection, and a really broad cheese variety.  Am i going to be grocery shopping here every week? No, I don&#39;t make enough money. If i did would I? Probably not, I like the market too much. Will I come here for specialty items or if I&#39;m in a rush and just need a few things? Sure. I can see others who place more value on organic and vegan options finding this place to be a haven though. I think the best part of Hart&#39;s is that it provides a new and different type of grocery option and AMEN to them for not using plastic bags!!!"

IMO Hart&#39;s is convenient, less cluttered than a local excellent chain, and offers many of the same high quality items.  At Hart&#39;s you can find the basics along with specialty items such as Black rice, non-nitrate pork products, and such. And, if you weigh out the costs of finding a parking spot, dealing with the crowds, etc... I think you&#39;ll find it balances out.

Upgraded from 4 stars to 5!   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~There is only one reason this place does not get 5 stars - the personalities of the workers.  Maybe I am spoiled by Wegmans but here is my story.  My husband and I ran in last weekend to see what it was all about - after visiting our great public market. I was impressed. I work downtown so to have this grocer so close it great!  Great selection and the prices seem to be on par with wegmans, some produce cheaper (avocados for instance).  I have also heard rave reviews of their prepared foods. So this morning, on my way to work, I stopped in for their famous signature breakfast sandwich. I walked up to the coffee counter and was ignored pretty much by the coffee girl. Eventually she acknowledged my existence and I ordered the sandwich and a 12 oz iced chai. She rang me up and walked to make my chai but started to pour a cup of regular coffee.  I corrected her and she reluctantly made me the chai - was it my problem that she didn&#39;t listen?  As I was waiting for the sandwich I drank my chai (which was very good).  The sandwich is a roll, egg, cheese, arugula, pancetta and a sriracha mayo. I have heard great things so I was really excited to try it. The cook never made eye contact with me - but when she served me I told her that I had heard great things about the sandwich and she basically blew me off and turned around.  I know I can be pretty chipper in the morning but a smile would have been nice. I kept hearing a song line in my head as I was exiting by our great Taylor Swift... &#34;you think your Indy record is much cooler than mine&#34;... I am apparently not trendy or alternative enough for the employees at Hart&#39;s market to acknowledge me.  I am not cool enough because I don&#39;t have a nose ring? Can you smell the cheesy pop music blaring from my car a mile away? I will probably go back but I won&#39;t be as friendly the next time around. I will grab my stuff and go because apparently that is the culture.  Wegman&#39;s has spoiled me with their good morning&#39;s and how can I help you. P.S The sandwich was excellent!"

Parking on the street was atrocious. Prices were high (as would be expected), but their choices were kinda odd. There are few things you wouldn&#39;t be able to find at larger Wegman&#39;s stores (in either the &#34;Natures Marketplace&#34;, or whatever they call their organic/high end sections now), with only a few &#39;local&#39; brands thrown it for good measure. The prepared food section, by the front, however, is EXTREMELY disorganized, and run by a bunch of entitled , clueless slackers. Prices are high, food takes FOREVER to come out,service is surly to absent, and those chairs they give you to sit on-yikes! Add to that the lack of heat, and what you have is a very cold, miserable dining experience, one which you will pay a premium to experience. I MIGHT return, if they happen to carry something that either Wegman&#39;s or Top&#39;s doesn&#39;t, but I will NEVER go back there for lunch again."

The atmosphere is really inviting and the selection of items are diverse and comprehensive so that you can consider this a &#34;one-stop shop&#34;. For example, in the dead of winter, they have show shovels, ice scrapers, antifreeze washer fluid, and firewood for sale in the entrance way. And instead of an industrial feel like you get at big box retailers, even these items are arranged in an aesthetically pleasing way. I hate to use the word &#34;cute&#34; which has lost meaning due to overuse, but this place can really be defined as a &#34;cute&#34; grocery store. They sell bakery items from local bakeries like Donuts Delite, coffees from local roasters, produce from local growers, etc. Occasionally they&#39;ve had produce available that I couldn&#39;t buy at the all-mighty Wegmans (which don&#39;t get me wrong, I am a Wegmans addict!) probably because their suppliers are local and they order smaller quantities. If you&#39;re inclined to care about where your food comes from and treatment of animals, this place sells locally sourced meats and cage-free eggs, as well as milk from Pittsford Dairy. Don&#39;t just stop by to check it out when you&#39;re in the area, but make a special trip to Hart&#39;s for shopping and a sampling of their prepared foods, or just grab a donut and coffee. Shopping is more of an experience here, similar to Wegmans, without the crowds and with a cooler atmosphere."

Their prepared salads are where it&#39;s at.  I always get the Citrus Ginger Tofu Soba Noodle Salad, Kale Tabbouleh, and their Lentil Salad.  Their prices make it so it&#39;s actually cheaper to buy things prepared vs making it yourself at home.  I&#39;ve even been buying their beets from the deli case because they are peeled and ready to eat, saving me the hassle of staining my hands and kitchen counters pink from the juice. I have found more unique items at Hart&#39;s than Lori&#39;s Natural Foods, which I was venturing out to sparingly because of it&#39;s location in Henrietta which causes me road rage.  Hart&#39;s is easy to get to and no lack of parking whatsoever. I hope that this grocer makes it and becomes a go-to establishment for those residing downtown and the surrounding areas.  I go there around 5:30 pm and find that there aren&#39;t many shoppers, I like to think the professionals working in that area are grocery shopping on their lunch break.

Danielle R, did you communicate your issues with the store directly to the manager?  Or did you write down your issues to their &#34;Two Cents&#34; board before writing your review?  I have a feeling you didn&#39;t, since that was not included in your review... Hart&#39;s reminds me of Fairway, an independent grocery chain in the NYC area.  Friendly staff with a good selection of local and regional fare with friendly staff and a selection that is more than adequate.  Sure, there aren&#39;t a million options like you would find in larger stores, and Wegmans is just down the road on East Ave, but Harts offers many of the essentials and a nice variety of unique products.  I appreciated that I could recognize many local names and brands throughout our visit.  Pricing, yeah, a little more expensive than the competitors, but  keep in mind that they are a new grocer without the buying power of Wegmans, Tops, or Trader Joe&#39;s.   However, I will say although I did notice the higher prices, I did not think they were unreasonable at all.  On my first visit with a small group of friends, we bought a sampling of the prepared foods, olives, cheeses, and breads to try.  We were all very impressed and happy with the amount of food we got for our $25 communal budget.  While I agree there is room for improvement, I was very impressed with what I saw for a brand new store.  My advice to everyone is let Hart&#39;s know what you would like to see so they can better tailor the store to your needs!"

Your experience here will be amazing, from the deli to the color and graphic typography on the walls, to the selection of local products (which I&#39;m sure will increase over time). A cute little store to hit up when you&#39;re done watching a movie at the Little or hanging for a cup of coffee at Spot."

Just tons of cool stuff!  They have a small area in the front to have a sandwich, coffee or whatever."

The people that work there are extremely friendly.  I was shocked at the delicious looking display of prepared food. They have the type of healthy creations that you would see on Pinterest well searching for healthy quick eats that you always say you are going to make but never do. The staff were happy to let me try anything I asked for along with giving me pointers on how to reheat without recooking. I ended up selecting Teriyaki salmon, kale tabouli, potato salad, potatoe pancakes, BBQ tofu, and chorizo Mac and cheese. The salmon was for my wife and she normally will not eat reheated fish but she loved it. She said it was the best salmon she has ever eaten. The kale tabouli was unbelievable. It was addicting and I couldn&#39;t stop eating it. The potato  pancakes reminded me of Perkins recipe for potato pancakes(meaning extremely good). Everything else o got was great. I checked out some of the items that were for sale that I would normally buy at Wegmans or Tops and compared the prices, as you would expect from a small grocery store the prices are somewhat higher on SOME products but not all. If you are a coupon saving mom then this isn&#39;t the place for you. The selection of locally made items was large and I was stunned to see all of the products that were produced in and around Rochester. I enjoy the convenience of the location seeing it is only 5 mins from my house. I highly recommend this place. Forget Wegmans with their over priced food bar!  Shop at Harts."

Unless of course there is a custom 4 million dollar Ferrari parked out front and the owner is driving around the parking lot like the Pope waving to everyone like Danny does at Wegmans. The increase in Wegmans food is paying for security guards to watch his car while he makes a grand entrance. It is Harts for us from now on. I have lost the little respect I had for Wegmans.

Maven&#39;s dairy free ice cream (THANK YOU FOR OFFERING THIS!) and the countless number of local products like Eat Me ice cream, Pittsford Dairy, Schutts apples etc... If you live in the area or are passing through, make a stop and see what I&#39;m talking about. Don&#39;t be too alarmed by the prices and make sure to check the specials.  Some of the products are a bit overpriced when comparing to supergiant Wegmans, but we have to remember that this is a smaller operation carrying a multitude of local and organic products--you actually get what you pay for!"

What a terrific selection of familiar staples and gourmet/foody items. I try to eat paleo (I know, I know) and I cook for children with numerous allergies. So I am THRILLED to find one store where I can get the standard items we normally shop for, as well as a great selection of gluten-free flours, and very high quality organic meats, eggs, dairy items and produce. I also like to shop local and Hart&#39;s makes it easy to do so with the shelves right by the cash register. I picked up some paleo sugar-free macaroons for a friend&#39;s birthday and she adored them. The wellness section at the back is so well-stocked I no longer have to order off Amazon or visit a separate health store - prices are quite reasonable, too! If you haven&#39;t, I urge you to try the Natural Calm powder, that stuff is life-changing. Finally, the little sandwich section at the front of the store has a terrific selection of really good breakfast and lunch sandwiches and there are plenty of tables and highchairs if you shop with the kids (which I do, so I also appreciate the big clean bathrooms with changing tables for Moms AND Dads - nice one!). The only downside of this place is that I will now feel sad whenever I have to shop somewhere else!"

I typically shop at Wegman&#39;s, Trader Joe&#39;s, Abundance, and Lori&#39;s as well as local Indian, Asian and farm markets. While it&#39;s true that Hart&#39;s doesn&#39;t have a huge inventory and won&#39;t replace any of them, it&#39;s become one of my routine grocery stops because I love the feel of the store and find products there that I can&#39;t find in other stores. As a vegan I find grocery shopping somewhat difficult in Rochester especially if I&#39;m looking for high quality local produce, artisan dairy free cheeses or harder to find ingredients. I was pleasantly surprised at Harts. I found beautiful king oyster mushrooms, Treeline cheese, umboshi paste, no beef soup base, Enjoy Life bars, Beyond Meat and the list just goes on. There are local products from Pudgy Girl Bakery and Small World, and then there&#39;s the bulk section where I can get quinoa and grains. It&#39;s so nice to see a bulk section that&#39;s easy to use and sells more than candy and processed food.  This is one of the few places where I can buy groceries and also get both bakery and prepared food that I can eat. They have vegetarian and vegan options that go beyond the usual salad wrap found in most Rochester cafe style restaurants. And another big bonus, the staff is extremely friendly and helpful and most importantly, knows their inventory and takes the time to talk to you about it. It&#39;s so refreshing to ask a question about a product and not get a blank stare in return.  All in all, I&#39;ve become a big fan of Harts and look forward to watching them grow and continue to provide great local and high quality products."

I also love love love the designated shelves for local products. However, as much as I love Pittsford Dairy, I&#39;m not, at any stage in my life, going to pay $7 for a gallon of milk.  In terms of walkability, it serves a relatively small area surrounding the store (a population with plenty of access and transportation to the lovely brand new Wegmans just up the road), but in terms of serving the larger community of Rochester, I&#39;m not sure how well it does that. I hope they prosper, but they could do with a bit more variety in terms of product and price points in order to make it a one-stop shop. In the meantime, I&#39;ll stop in every now and then for local things, and continue to buy my milk at Wegs."

There are accessories galore and always a friendly person to help in any way. There isn&#39;t any sales pressure, which is smart, because often it takes many visits trying different models before selecting one for purchase. And no one likes to be followed around during the process, which thankfully they do not do. But if you need a demo or have questions, they&#39;re there. Bernunzio&#39;s Uptown Music website is informative and easy to navigate, with contact information clearly stated. You&#39;ll find a listing of jam sessions, vintage instruments, flea market, parts, and more. The emailed newsletter is short, which I appreciate, and contains info about community music events. They host many well known musicians that teach a workshop in-house, and the newsletter lists what&#39;s on sale or what&#39;s new in the store, and events or performances to watch for. After much trying out, I purchased the perfect instrument for me at Bernunzio&#39;s. They helped with set up and strap placement, very personal service.

But, I can say they have really great live music events quite often.  Just recently, I went to see one of my favorite Rochester original artists, rap duo Garden Fresh.  Normally, at most venues when I go to see them, it&#39;s really crowded and dark and my feet keep getting stuck on the sticky floor.  So I loved their show at Bernunzio.  Not only are there folding chairs if you arrive early enough to get one, but they&#39;re those fancy ones with really thick padding so your butt doesn&#39;t hurt after sitting on them for a couple of hours.  In addition to their live shows, they also have jam sessions for artists to rock out.  And, if you don&#39;t have an instrument, I&#39;m sure they&#39;d be happy to get you started.
